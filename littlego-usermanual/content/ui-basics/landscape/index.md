    title: iPhone user interface areas in portrait and landscape orientation
---

Below you can see how the user interface looks like on an iPhone device, both in portrait and in landscape orientation.

To make optimal use of the available space the areas of the user interface are shifted around when the orientation changes. The annotation numbers in the illustration show where each area goes when the user interface orientation changes from portrait to landscape, and vice versa.

{{< hint type=note >}}
On iPad devices the basic layout is the same as on iPhone devices. The only difference is the amount of space that is available to each user interface element.
{{< /hint >}}

The [main page]({{< relref "../.." >}}) of this user manual has more information on the meaning of each of the numbered UI areas.
