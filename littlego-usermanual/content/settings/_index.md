This section of the user manual contains pages describing user preferences that can be changed in the Settings {{< icon "settings" >}} area of the app.

{{< hint type=info >}}
Most settings do not have a dedicated user manual page, instead they are explained in the appropriate context. For instance, all "Scoring" settings are explained in the [Scoring]({{< relref "../playing-the-game/scoring" >}}) user manual page.
