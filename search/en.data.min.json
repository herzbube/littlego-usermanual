In this mode you can place black or white stones in any order and combination to set up the initial board before you begin to play moves. The only restriction is that the board position you thus create is legal. In practice this means that the app will not allow you to place stones that create a stone group that has no liberties.\nIn addition to placing stones, you can select the side which is to play the first move. This overrides the normal game rules which specify that in an even game black plays first, and in a game with handicap white plays first.\nSwitching to/from board setup mode Placing stones in board setup mode Stone color cycles Board zooming Illegal board positions Discarding the board Board setup vs. handicap Setting up a side to play first Board setup vs. game with moves Switching to/from board setup mode By default the app places you in Play mode when you start a new game. To activate Board Setup mode you can then select the \u0026ldquo;Set up board\u0026rdquo; item from the menu that pops up when you tap the Menu button. The idea is that usually you want to play, and setting up a board position is the exception.\nYou can change this default behaviour in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Board setup \u0026gt; Auto-enable board setup\u0026rdquo;. When you turn on this option the app will automatically activate Board Setup mode whenever you start a new game and it is your turn to play first. If it is the computer player\u0026rsquo;s turn to play first it will immediately play a move instead.\nWhile Board Setup mode is active you can tap the Play button at any time to return to Play mode.\nAs soon as you play a move the \u0026ldquo;Set up board\u0026rdquo; item disappears from the menu that pops up when you tap the Menu button. The menu item will reappear when you discard all moves, or when you navigate back to board position 0, i.e. the start of the game. Placing stones in board setup mode In Board Setup mode you place a stone by tapping on an empty intersection. A button indicates which color the newly placed stone will have. Besides being an indicator, the button also acts as a toggle: When you tap it, it switches to the opposing color and from now on newly placed stones will have that color.\nThe button indicates that newly placed setup stones will be black. Tapping the button switches the default color for new setup stones from black to white. The button indicates that newly placed setup stones will be white. Tapping the button switches the default color for new setup stones from white to black. Stone color cycles When you place a stone, then tap again on the same intersection, the stone changes its color. If you tap again on the same intersection, the stone is removed. The cycle then begins again. So, depending on which is the default stone color, you get one of these two cycles:\nEmpty intersection \u0026gt; Black stone \u0026gt; White stone \u0026gt; Empty intersection. Empty intersection \u0026gt; White stone \u0026gt; Black stone \u0026gt; Empty intersection. The intent is to help you quickly set up board positions without having to toggle between the default stone color all the time.\nThe app does not follow these two cycles if doing so would result in an illegal board position. Read more. Board zooming Hitting the right intersection with a single tap can be difficult if the device is small and the board is large. Unlike when you are in Play mode, hitting the wrong intersection during Board Setup mode has no consequences - you can remove the stone again by quickly tapping the same intersection two more times.\nUsually on iOS devices a double-tap gesture like this is interpreted as a request to zoom in, and when in Play mode double-tapping does exactly this: It zooms in the board by 50%. But when in Board Setup mode, quickly tapping the same spot has no special meaning because, as explained above, the app wants you to be able to change what is on an intersection by quickly and repeatedly tapping on the intersection.\nZooming is still available via the standard pinch gesture. You can restore the double-tap gesture to its normal zoom meaning in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Board setup \u0026gt; Double-tap to zoom\u0026rdquo;.\nIllegal board positions An illegal board position can occur if placing a stone would create a stone group that has no liberties. In a previous section on this page you have seen that the app follows one of two cycles when you attempt to place a stone. However, if following the cycle would result in an illegal board position, the app breaks the cycle and tries an alternative. If the alternative still results in an illegal board position, the app displays an alert with information about what the problem is and why the board situation is illegal.\nThis feature of trying out alternatives can be very useful when you set up stairs, or other complex board positions consisting of intertwined stone groups. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like the feature you can turn it off in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Board setup \u0026gt; Try not to place illegal stones\u0026rdquo;.\nThis is how the \u0026ldquo;magic\u0026rdquo; alternative-finding works:\nWhen you tap on an empty intersection, and placing a stone with the default color would be illegal, the app instead tries to place a stone that is the opposing color of the default color. When you tap on an intersection that is occupied by a stone of the default color, and placing a stone that is the opposing color of the default color would be illegal, the app instead removes the stone. Discarding the board If you are not happy with the current board setup, you can tap the Discard all Setup Information button (visible only if you have placed at least one stone). This will throw away all stones that are currently on the board, with the exception of handicap stones which will remain on the board.\nThe app displays an alert and asks for confirmation before it actually clears the board. Board setup vs. handicap Playing a game with handicap results in a special kind of board setup: Handicap stones. While in Board Setup mode handicap stones are displayed with a special mark so that you can distinguish them from regular setup stones. Board setup with handicap stones Handicap stones are treated specially because under area scoring rules handicap has a direct influence on the game\u0026rsquo;s score: White receives compensation for each handicap stone. When you tap a handicap stone the app removes it from the board so that you can place a regular setup stone on the empty intersection. Under area scoring rules the app also reduces the handicap compensation by 1.\nThe app alerts you when this happens, giving you the opportunity to abort and keep the handicap stone. You can disable the alert in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Board setup \u0026gt; Change handicap alert\u0026rdquo;.\nBecause handicap is more related to game rules than to board setup, the app currently does not provide a way to place new handicap stones while in Board Setup mode. If you accidentally remove a handicap stone you have to start a new game to get it back.\nSetting up a side to play first Besides placing setup stones, you can also select the side which is to play the first move while in Board Setup mode. Select the \u0026ldquo;Set up a side to play first\u0026rdquo; item from the menu that pops up when you tap the Menu button. This pops up another screen where you can select between the different options.\nIf you have previously made a choice that overrides the normal game rules, you can select the \u0026ldquo;Game rules\u0026rdquo; option to revert back to the normal game rules.\nBoard setup vs. game with moves You can change the board setup only if no moves have been played yet. The reason is simple: Moves build upon each other, and the very first move of the game builds upon the initial board position that exists when the game is started. When you change this initial board position, the first move thus becomes invalid, and with it all future nodes that in turn build upon the first move.\nSo when you want to change something about the board setup, and one or more moves have already been played, the app will automatically discard all nodes. The app will alert you when this is about to happen, giving you the opportunity to abort and keep those nodes. You can disable the alert in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Board position \u0026gt; Discard future nodes alert\u0026rdquo;.\n","description":"When you start a new game, instead of beginning to play you can switch to Board Setup mode.

How can I pass / play a pass move? Tap the button with the \u0026ldquo;three dots\u0026rdquo; icon: .\nWhat are the functions of all those buttons? This page provides an overview of how buttons are organized, as well as a full reference of all buttons that exist in the Play area of the app.\nIn addition the How to play page provides a useful overview of how some buttons work from a functional point of view.\nThe computer is too strong / too weak, what can I do? When you start a new game you can select which computer player to play against. The first thing you can do is to select a weaker computer player from the list.\nThe second thing you can do is, you can edit the settings of a computer player to make it weaker.\nIn the Play area of the app, tap the Game Info button to find out which computer player you are playing against (select the \u0026ldquo;Game\u0026rdquo; segment then scroll down to the section titled \u0026ldquo;Players\u0026rdquo; to find this information). Tap the computer player\u0026rsquo;s entry. This will take you directly to a screen where you can edit the player\u0026rsquo;s settings. Tap on \u0026ldquo;Playing strength\u0026rdquo;, select a new value, then tap \u0026ldquo;Done\u0026rdquo;. Tap \u0026ldquo;Done\u0026rdquo; again to dismiss the \u0026ldquo;Edit player\u0026rdquo; screen. The new playing strength will immediately take effect. In step 3, you can instead tap \u0026ldquo;Advanced configuration\u0026rdquo; if you want to tweak individual computer player settings. Consult The computer player page to learn about the meaning of each setting, especially the section Limiting the computer’s playing strength.\nPlayer influence is not displayed, or is completely wrong, what can I do? Tap the Menu button and select \u0026ldquo;Update player influence\u0026rdquo; from the menu that pops up.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t see this menu entry, you need to enable \u0026ldquo;Display player influence\u0026rdquo; in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Display settings\u0026rdquo;.\nIf this setting is already enabled, then you are not in Play mode - player influence can be seen only when this mode is active. Tap the Play button to activate Play mode. If you still don\u0026rsquo;t see player influence, select the \u0026ldquo;Update player influence\u0026rdquo; menu entry mentioned above.\nAlso read the Player influence page to learn about important background information.\nMove numbers / coordinate labels are not displayed even though they are enabled in the user preferences The app automatically calculates the font size that is required to display move numbers and coordinate labels. The font size depends on the board size (a bigger board means a smaller font) and the amount of space available for drawing the board (a smaller screen means a smaller font).\nIf as a result of these calculations the font becomes too small, you will no longer be able to read move numbers and coordinate labels. The app in this case decides that it is better to not display those items at all, and to use the space thus gained for drawing a board that is slightly larger.\nTo still see move numbers and coordinate labels you just have to zoom the board sufficiently. Once the zoom scale has reached a certain degree, things will automatically start to show up.\nMarkup labels are not displayed See previous question.\nWhat is an \u0026ldquo;Auto-created player\u0026rdquo;? When the app launches, it automatically starts a game with those two players that it remembers were playing last time when the app was active. If for any reason one or both of those players no longer exist, the app will try to recover by automatically creating one or two new players. Players created in this way get the name \u0026ldquo;Auto-created player\u0026rdquo; to give you a hint what happened.\nIn practice, you should never see an auto-created player because that would indicate a bug somewhere in the application. However, if you do see such a player, and you know how you managed to convince the app to create it, please let me know so that I can fix the problem.\n","description":"How do I change the board size?

The table is not intended to be read top-down - if you are new the recommended starting point is the term → Node. From there you can follow the cross-references indicated by an arrow (→).\nThe \u0026ldquo;Example(s)\u0026rdquo; column in the table refers to the annotations from the following illustration of a hypothetical game tree.\nGlossary annotations Term Definition Example(s) Board position The result of applying the content of a → node to the board. Branch A sequence of → nodes, starting at the → child node of a → branching node and ending at a → leaf node. A branch is a partial → game variation. Branch 1: Nodes C-J. Branch 2: E-J. Branch 3: I-J. Branch 4: K-M. Branch 5: N. Branch 6: O-Q. Branch 7: Q. Branch 8: R. Branch 9: S-T. Branching node A → node where game play branches into different → game variations. A branching node is a node that has two or more → child nodes. Nodes B, D, H, P are branching nodes. Child node A successor → node of another node. The other node is the → parent node of the child node. A node with two or more child nodes is a → branching node. A node without a child node is a → leaf node. All nodes except A are child nodes. Current game variation The → game variation that is currently selected in the user interface. The current game variation is rendered with a red path. The current game variaton consists of nodes A, B, C, D, K, L and M. Current node The → node that is currently selected in the user interface. The board shows the content of the current node. The current node is rendered with a red circle. Node L is the current node. Game tree The totality of all → game variations added together. The game tree is made up of → nodes. The start of the game tree is the → root node. Game variation A sequence of → nodes, starting at the → root node and ending at a → leaf node. Variation 1: Nodes A-J. Variation 2: A-N. Variation 3: A-M. Variation 4: A-Q. Variation 5: A-T. Variation 6: A-R. Leaf node A → node after which there are no further nodes. A leaf node has no → child nodes. Nodes J, M, N, Q, R and T are leaf nodes. Main line Synonym for → main variation. The main line consists of nodes A-J. Main variation The → game variation that consists of the main line of play, i.e. the game as it was actually played. The main variation is always rendered at the top of the → game tree. The main variation consists of nodes A-J. Node The basic unit of the → game tree. A node is a container for information such as the move that was played, annotations explaining the node content, or markup to be drawn on the board to highlight a stone or group of stones. Parent node The predecessor → node of another node. The only node that does not have a parent node is the → root node. All nodes except → leaf nodes are parent nodes. All nodes except the leaf nodes J, M, N, Q, R and T are parent nodes. Root node The → node located at the root of the → game tree. The root node represents the start of the game. Instead of a move it contains information such as komi, handicap or board setup. Node A is the root node. Sibling node A → child node that shares a common → parent node with another child node. Nodes C, O, R are siblings. Nodes E and K are siblings. Nodes Q and S are siblings. Nodes I and N are siblings. The tree view Basic features The app renders the game tree in a tree view which is always located below the game board. In previous illustrations on this page you may have already noticed some of the basic characteristics of the view:\nThe game tree is rendered lying on the side. The root node is in the top-left corner. The main variation is at the top. In addition, the basic interactons are:\nIf the game tree takes up more space than is available you can use the usual swipe gesture to scroll the tree view content in all directions. Also if the game tree elements are rendered too small you can use the usual pinch/zoom gestures to zoom in and out. A double-tap gesture zooms in on the board by 50%. Resizing and hiding the view The tree view shares the available vertical space with the game board and possibly some other views. Just above the tree view there is a small translucent bar (outlined in the illustraton with a red rectangle) that you can tap and drag up or down to resize the tree view.\nIf you do not need the tree view at all you can turn it off in the Settings user interface area under \u0026ldquo;Tree view \u0026gt; Display tree view\u0026rdquo;.\nDrag handle to resize Resize animation - tap to expand ↕ Your browser does not support the video tag. Branching lines The tree view draws lines between nodes to indicate how the nodes are connected. The first child node is always drawn on the same row as its parent node and the two are connected by a horizontal line.\nIf a node has several child nodes it becomes a branching node where two or more game variations originate. The second, third, etc. child node are connected to their parent node with a non-horizontal branching line. In the Settings user interface area under \u0026ldquo;Tree view \u0026gt; Branching style\u0026rdquo; you can select between two styles how the tree view should render branching lines.\nThis is how the diagonal branching style looks like. It is the default style because it results in a compact rendering of the game tree with as few rows as possible. Diagonal branching style This is how the right-angle branching style looks like.\nThe illustraton shows exactly the same game tree as the previous illustraton for the diagonal branching style. The advantage of this style is that if there are many branches close to each other it can result in a game tree that is more easily readable. The drawback is that the game tree can take up a lot more vertical space than the diagonal branching style.\nRight-angle branching style Tabular display and node numbering The tree view by default renders the game tree in a tabular fashion:\nRows are filled with game variations. Columns are filled with the nodes of the game tree. This tabular display is possible because all nodes take up the same horizontal and vertical space. The Condense moves section further down on this page illustrates a setting which, when enabled, causes a non-tabular display.\nAs can be seen in the next illustration, the tree view displays a header with numbers at the top. This is used to number the nodes in the game tree, indicating their distance from the root node. The root node therefore has node number 0 (zero).\nAs long as the game tree is shown in its default tabular fashion, the node number can also be understood as the table column number.\nNode numbers In a game tree where all nodes contain a move, the node number and the move number are the same. The header with node numbers remains visible at all times, even when you scroll the tree view downwards. Current game variation and current node At any given time one of the variations in the game tree is selected, and one of the nodes within that game variation is selected. The tree view uses the color red to indicate the current selection:\nIt marks the currently selected game variation with a red path going through all the lines that connect the variation\u0026rsquo;s nodes. It marks the currently selected node with a red outline. It renders the node number of the current node in red color. Current game variation and current node In the Settings user interface area under \u0026ldquo;Tree view \u0026gt; Node selecton style\u0026rdquo; you can select between three styles how the tree view should render the selected node. The default style is \u0026ldquo;Light \u0026amp; circular\u0026rdquo;.\nNode selection style \u0026#34;Light \u0026amp; circular\u0026#34; (the default style) Node selection style \u0026#34;Heavy \u0026amp; circular\u0026#34; Node selection style \u0026#34;Heavy \u0026amp; rectangular\u0026#34; You can tap on a node to make it the currently selected node. If the currently selected game variation does not contain the newly selected node, then the first game variation that contains the node becomes the currently selected game variation. Node symbol and content Nodes are rendered with a symbol that indicates what the node contains. The basic content rules are:\nSetup and moves are the main node content. When present their symbol takes precedence over the symbol of other content. Setup and moves are mutually exclusive. A node may contain one or the other, but not both. Setup can be present in nodes beyond the root node, but not after the first move. The root node may contain setup, but no move. Annotations and markup can be present in all nodes, either on their own or in addition to other content. The following table documents all the possible symbols and their meanings.\nSymbol Description A root node that contains a komi value greater than zero. The node does not contain setup, annotations or markup. A root node that contains a handicap value greater than zero. The node does not contain setup, annotations or markup. A root node that contains both a handicap and a komi value greater than zero. The node does not contain setup, annotations or markup. A plain root node without handicap, komi or any other content. A node that contains a black move. In addition the node may contain annotations and/or markup, but no setup. A node that contains a white move. In addition the node may contain annotations and/or markup, but no setup. A node that contains annotations. The node does not contain a move, setup or markup. A node that contains markup. The node does not contain a move, setup or annotations. A node that contains both annotations and markup. The node does not contain a move or setup. A node that contains black setup stones. In addition the node may contain annotations and/or markup, but no move. A node that contains white setup stones. In addition the node may contain annotations and/or markup, but no move. A node that clears setup stones from a previous node. In addition the node may contain annotations and/or markup, but no move. A node that contains black and white setup stones. In addition the node may contain annotations and/or markup, but no move. A node that contains black setup stones and also clears setup stones from a previous node. In addition the node may contain annotations and/or markup, but no move. A node that contains white setup stones and also clears setup stones from a previous node. In addition the node may contain annotations and/or markup, but no move. A node that contains black and white setup stones and also clears setup stones from a previous node. In addition the node may contain annotations and/or markup, but no move. The app currently does not support creating the following nodes:\nA node that contains only annotations and/or markup but no move. A node beyond the root node that contains setup. Board setup is restricted to the root node. Such nodes can exist, though, when you load SGF files from the archive that were created by other programs.\nHow to create a game variation When a new game begins and you start playing moves, then those moves are simply added one after the other, forming the linear sequence of moves known as the main line, or main game variation.\nTo create a game variation you first have to go back in the main line to a node that contains an older move. When you make a move now, the app creates a new game variation with the move you just made as the first move of the branch that deviates from the main line.\nBy default new game variations are inserted below the current game variation. You can change the location in the Settings user interface area under \u0026ldquo;Game variations \u0026gt; New game variation insert position\u0026rdquo;. In the following animation the user can be seen to go back to move 2 after playing move 4. When the user then plays a new move a new game variation is inserted with the new move being move 3. Another game variation is created when the user goes back to the root node and plays a move there.\nYour browser does not support the video tag. If you do not want to play with game variations you can turn the feature off in the Settings user interface area under \u0026ldquo;Game variations \u0026gt; Move creates new game variation when future nodes exist\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen the setting is disabled the app instead discards future nodes in the current game variation and replaces them with the new move.\nSettings Align moves By default the tree view draws nodes one after the other as they appear in their game variations. If the game tree contains nodes without moves, then the tree view may draw nodes with moves that have the same move number in different horizontal positons.\nThis can be changed in the Settings user interface area under \u0026ldquo;Tree view \u0026gt; Align moves\u0026rdquo;. When you turn this option on then nodes with moves that have the same move number are drawn in the same horizontal positon.\nNormal display, moves are not aligned This illustration shows that the node with move number 1 in different game variations is drawn in different positions:\nMain variation: The node with move number 1 has node number 10. Variation 2: The node with move number 1 has node number 3. Variation 3: The node with move number 1 has node number 7. Aligned moves When the \u0026ldquo;Align moves\u0026rdquo; setting is enabled, all 3 nodes with move number 1 are aligned on the same horizontal position.\nThe drawback of aligning moves is that the game tree can take up a lot more horizontal space.\nWhen move nodes are aligned their node number within the game variation does not change. The consequence is that when the \u0026ldquo;Align moves\u0026rdquo; setting is enabled node numbering takes place only for the current game variation.\nThe following illustration shows that in game variation 2 the node with move number 1 still has node number 3 (compare to original illustration without move alignment). Aligned moves, nodes numbered only for current game variation Condense moves By default the tree view displays all nodes with the same size. This can be changed in the Settings user interface area under \u0026ldquo;Tree view \u0026gt; Condense moves\u0026rdquo;. When this setting is turned on, move nodes within a sequence of move nodes are condensed, i.e. they are drawn smaller than move nodes at the beginning or end of the sequence.\nThe purpose of condensing move nodes is to de-emphasize repetitive content and to enable focusing on interesting nodes in the game tree. This is done at the cost of making the tree look less uniform.\nNormal display, moves are not condensed Condensed moves The second illustration shows that certain move nodes are drawn with full size even though they are not at the beginning or end of a sequence of move nodes. These are the exceptions:\nA move node that is a branching node (node number 4 in the illustration). Such a node is considered interesting because it marks a turning point in the game where different decisions lead to different game play. A move node that is the beginning of a new branch (node number 5 in three variations). Similarly to branching nodes, such nodes are interesting because they contain the actual move that differs from other branches. A move node that is the leaf node of a game variation. These nodes are interesting because they contain the result of playing out the game variation. When move nodes are condensed the horizontal positioning of nodes can greatly vary and it is no longer possible to uniformly number nodes across all game variations in a tabular fashion. The consequence is that when the \u0026ldquo;Condense moves\u0026rdquo; setting is enabled node numbering takes place only for the current game variation.\nIn addition, the node number of a condensed move node takes up more space than the node it is numbering. This becomes more evident when node numbers have 2, 3 or even 4 digits. Because of this there are gaps in numbering consecutive condensed move nodes, as can be seen above in the second illustration.\nFocus on selected node One way to change the selected node is to tap on that node in the tree view. However, there are also other triggers outside the tree view that can change the selected node. Examples are when you or the computer play a new move, or when you go to the start or end of the current game variation via one of the navigation buttons (see page The current game variation).\nBy default when the selected node changes the tree view scrolls to make the newly selected node visible. This behaviour can be changed in the Settings user interface area under \u0026ldquo;Tree view \u0026gt; Focus on selected node\u0026rdquo;.\nYou can either disable focusing on the selected node entirely, or select between three focusing modes.\nFocus mode \u0026ldquo;Scroll to make visible\u0026rdquo; Condition: The node tree view focus-scrolls only if the newly selected node is currently not visible, or only partially visible.\nAction: The view scrolls just enough to make the newly selected node fully visible at one of the view\u0026rsquo;s edges.\nAnimation - tap to expand ↕ Your browser does not support the video tag.

The format is decades old and widely used to store and transfer Go games between computer systems. External link to SGF specification.\nThe app internally uses a software package named SGFC (the SGF Syntax Checker \u0026amp; Converter) to load and save SGF data. External link to SGFC website.\nThis page describes the technical details how the app uses SGFC to process SGF data, and the settings you can change to influence the processing.\nSGF processing SGFC messages Load result SGF standard conformance \u0026amp; Settings introduction Syntax checking settings Simple vs. advanced configuration of syntax checking Load success type Restrictive checking Disable all warning messages Disabled messages Text encoding settings Encoding mode Default encoding Enforced encoding Other settings Reverse variation ordering SGF processing SGFC messages Behind every item that is listed in the Archive area of the app (see The game archive) there is one SGF file. Tapping the archive item loads the SGF file\u0026rsquo;s content and puts it through SGFC to parse the SGF data. Whenever SGFC finds something suspicious or wrong in the data it generates a message. It does this separately for each issue it finds, so that in the end parsing the data of a single SGF file can result in many different messages.\nMessages are classified with two criteria: Message type and message criticality.\nMessage type Message types in ascending order of severity are:\nWarning Error Fatal Error Warnings and errors still allow the SGF data to be parsed, but a fatal error generally means the SGF data is broken in some fundamental way and cannot be parsed.\nMessage criticality A warning or error message can be critical or non-critial. Fatal errors are neither critical nor non-critical - they are, well, fatal.\nA critical warning or error message indicates that the SGF data may be severely damaged.\nA critical warning is more severe than a non-critical error.\nLoad result You see SGFC messages when you tap an archive item and the app displays the \u0026ldquo;View archive content\u0026rdquo; screen. See the Game archive page for details how the screen looks like.\nNear the top of the screen is a section titled \u0026ldquo;Load result\u0026rdquo;. This shows you at a glance a summary of the messages generated by SGFC when it parsed the SGF data.\nIdeally the load result is \u0026ldquo;0 warnings, 0 errors\u0026rdquo;, which means that SGFC did not find any issues with the SGF data.\nIf the load result is anything else than \u0026ldquo;0 warnings, 0 errors\u0026rdquo; then you can tap the load result summary item to see the actual list of messages that were generated by SGFC.\nLoad result with zero warnings and errors Load result with 1 warning and 0 errors Load result with a fatal error If you wish you can even drill down into an individual message to see the low-level data of which the message consists. This can be interesting because most messages contain the actual line and column number where SGFC found the issue in the SGF file.\nLoad result details, listing all messages generated by SGFC Message details, showing low-level message data SGF standard conformance \u0026amp; Settings introduction SGFC is very strict and generates many messages when it finds SGF data that does not conform to the SGF standard. As long as you load only SGF files from the archive that you have saved in the app you will be fine and see no messages (i.e. you will see the \u0026ldquo;0 warnings, 0 errors\u0026rdquo; load result), because the app strictly adheres to the SGF standard. When you import SGF files from external sources, though, you may start to see some messages from SGFC that complain about various things in the SGF data that are not correct. The reason is simple: Not all applications that generate SGF data adhere as strictly to the SGF standard as they should.\nTo let you deal with situations where you are unable to load an SGF file from an external source, the app offers various settings that influence the way how SGF data is processed when you load a game from the archive. The next sections on this page discuss the details of these settings.\nYou find the settings in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Smart Game Format (SGF)\u0026rdquo;.\nSmart Game Format (SGF) settings screen Syntax checking settings The SGF syntax checking settings define how strict SGFC should be when it checks an SGF file\u0026rsquo;s conformity to the standard, which warning and/or error messages SGFC should not generate even if it detects a problem, and what kinds of warning and/or error messages may be present for the app to still accept SGF data and load it.\nSimple vs. advanced configuration of syntax checking The simplest way to change the SGF syntax checking settings is to select from a number of syntax checking levels.\nIn general, levels range from less syntax checking to more syntax checking. Each level represents a different set of predefined settings values. By selecting a syntax checking level you are effectively changing several settings with a single tap, without having to understand what the individual settings do.\nIndividual syntax checking settings are also open to manual tweaking. To do so, tap the \u0026ldquo;Advanced configuration\u0026rdquo; item in the syntax checking section of the SGF settings screen. Before you start changing things, however, it is probably a good idea to first read through the next sections so that you better understand what you can accomplish by manipulating each setting.\nThe default (and recommended) syntax checking level is Medium. It strikes a balance between indicating almost all SGFC messages (except some of the most common and trivial warnings) and still allowing most SGF files to be loaded (except those with critical SGFC messages). The following table shows how each syntax checking level maps to the individual settings.\nMinimal Medium Strict Maximum Load success type With critical warnings/errors No critical warnings/errors No warnings/errors No warnings/errors Restrictive checking No No No Yes Disable all warning messages Yes No No No Disabled messages 17, 40, 55, 19, 60 17, 40, 55, 19, 60 17, 40, 55, 19, 60 None Load success type This setting defines what kinds of warning and/or error messages may be present for the app to still accept SGF data and load it.\nSetting Description No warnings/errors This is the strictest setting. The app only loads SGF data if the data is fully SGF conformant and there are no warnings or errors whatsoever. No critical warnings/errors This is a moderate setting and the recommended default. The app is allowed to load SGF data for which there are some warnings and/or errors, as long as they are not critical. SGF data with critical warnings and/or errors still cannot be loaded. With critical warnings/errors This is the most relaxed setting. It allows the app to load SGF data even if the SGF data has severe problems and there are critical warnings and/or errors. Force loading SGF data When you tap an archive item and the currently selected load success type causes the loading of SGF data to fail you will see an item \u0026ldquo;No games available\u0026rdquo;. Below that item there is a \u0026ldquo;Force loading\u0026rdquo; button that you can tap to override the app\u0026rsquo;s decision to not load the SGF data.\nFatal errors always cause the loading of SGF data to fail. SGF data with a fatal error cannot be force-loaded because it is broken in some fundamental way and cannot be parsed. Force loading an SGF file Restrictive checking This setting, if enabled, makes SGF data parsing even more pedantic than usual. More warnings and errors are generated, and in some cases messages that were already generated without this setting are now promoted in severity (e.g. warnings may become errors).\nThis setting is designed to flag all kinds of bad style or uncommon characteristics in SGF data. Because it makes it more difficult to load SGF data it is mostly intended for those users who are curious to see if SGF data they obtained from an external source is well-formed.\nDisable all warning messages Turning on this setting causes all warnings (both critical and non-critical) to be disabled, meaning they are not generated in the first place. This setting has two main uses:\nConveniently get rid of many annoying messages with a single tap. Get rid of one or more critical warnings that prevent SGF data from being loaded. Note that you can also achieve this by manipulating the Load success type setting. This setting is somewhat dangerous as it blanks out many useful messages and even avoids warnings that are indicators for critical problems in the SGF data. Therefore enable this option only with care! Disabled messages This setting lets you disable specific warning and/or error messages (both critical and non-critical). Messages are identified by their number. You disable a specific message simply by adding its ID number to the list.\nUnlike the Disable all warning messages setting which blankets out all warning messages indiscriminately, this setting gives you more precision, but on the other hand it\u0026rsquo;s more work to maintain the list. If you want to read up on the possible messages, their ID numbers and what their meaning is, you can consult the SGFC documentation (external link).\nThe app curates a short list of messages that are disabled by default. Here is the list with the reasons why the messages are disabled:\nMessage ID Message meaning Disable reason 17 The SGF data contains an empty property value. In addition to warning about it, SGFC automatically deletes the property because without value it has no meaning. This kind of problem is harmless enough to ignore it. 19 The SGF data contains one or more games that are not Go games. This problem does not need to be reported as a message because the app automatically ignores all non-Go SGF data. In the extreme case that a valid SGF file does not contain any Go games at all, the app simply shows \u0026ldquo;No games available\u0026rdquo; on the \u0026ldquo;View archive content\u0026rdquo; screen. 40 The SGF data contains a property that is not defined in the version of the SGF standard denoted by the FF property in the SGF data. This inconsistency commonly occurs because the SGF data does not contain the FF property at all, which implies version 1 of the SGF standard, but in reality the SGF data contains version 4 standard properties. Seeing that the most recent version of the SGF standard, version 4, was published decades ago (in 1999) it seems safe to assume that modern-day SGF generating applications actually want to write version 4 SGF data but just forgot to include the FF[4] property. 55 The SGF data contains an empty node. Empty nodes are not a problem and can simply be ignored, which is why this message is disabled. 60 The SGF data contains more than one game tree. This problem does not need to be reported as a message because the app automatically presents all game trees to the user for loading on the \u0026ldquo;View archive content\u0026rdquo; screen (sections titled \u0026ldquo;Game \u0026lt;n\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo;), so there is no danger in surplus game trees beyond the first being skipped over. Text encoding settings Because Go is played in many countries all over the world the handling of text encodings is of particular importance when reading and interpreting SGF data, An SGF data processing application such as Little Go cannot make the assumption that the SGF data it processes consists of only ASCII data - to the contrary, when the SGF data originates in Asian countries it is almost guaranteed that the data will contain multi-byte character sets such as Traditional or Simplified Chinese, the Korean alphabet Hangul, or a form of the Japanese writing system.\nFor this reason the app provides a number of rather technical settings that let the user control all aspects of text encoding handling that are supported by SGFC.\nEncoding mode This setting defines how the text encoding should be determined with which to interpret SGF data when it is loaded.\nSetting Description Single encoding This mode means that the SGF data is examined for CA properties that specify the text encoding to use. The first CA property that is found is used. If no CA property is found the default text encoding is used. All game trees in the entire SGF data are interpreted with the single text encoding that has been determined in this way. Multiple enncodings This mode means that each game tree in the SGF data is interpreted separately with its own text encoding. If a game tree has a CA property the text encoding specified by that property is used. If a game tree has no CA property the default text encoding is used. Try both modes This setting means that the app first attempts to load the SGF data with the \u0026ldquo;Single encoding\u0026rdquo; mode. If this fails with a fatal error the app makes a second attempt with the \u0026ldquo;Multiple encodings\u0026rdquo; mode. This setting is intended to be used when most of the time you work with SGF data that contains a single encoding (i.e. \u0026ldquo;Single encoding\u0026rdquo; mode works fine), but occasionally you also work with SGF data that contains multiple encodings (i.e. \u0026ldquo;Single encoding\u0026rdquo; mode fails with a fatal error) and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to go to the settings screen every time to switch between the two modes. The \u0026ldquo;Single encoding\u0026rdquo; mode has the special property that it allows SGF data to be read that begins with a Unicode byte-order mark (BOM). If a BOM is found the BOM instead of the first CA property determines the text encoding to use. This is the ONLY way how UTF-16 or UTF-32 encoded SGF data can be loaded. Default encoding This setting defines which text encoding to use if the SGF data does not contain a CA property that explicitly specifies the text encoding.\nWhen left blank the default encoding specified by the SGF standard is used, which is ISO-8859-1.\nThis setting is useful when an SGF file in the archive contains no CA property but the file is encoded with a text encoding that is not ISO-8859-1.\nWhen you enter a text encoding the app checks whether the name you entered is valid and supported on your device. If the check fails the app displays an alert. If the check succeeds the app does not display an alert.\nEnforced encoding This setting defines which text encoding to use at all times when loading SGF data. This encoding overrides any CA properties that exist in the SGF data.\nWhen left blank no text encoding is enforced.\nThis setting is useful when an SGF file in the archive contains a CA property that specifies one encoding, but the file is actually encoded with a different encoding. In that case loading of the SGF file will likely fail. If you know the file\u0026rsquo;s encoding you can enforce it, which will allow you to load the file.\nWhen you enter a text encoding the app checks whether the name you entered is valid and supported on your device. If the check fails the app displays an alert. If the check succeeds the app does not display an alert.\nOther settings Reverse variation ordering This setting fixes bad style SGF data, where the main line of a game is not in the main branch (variation \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo;), but instead is the last variation.\nWhen this setting is turned on variations are reordered when a game is loaded. For instance, A, B, C, D is reordered to D, C, B, A.\n","description":"Items listed in the Archive area of the app (see The game archive) are games saved in the Smart Game Format, which is generally abbreviated to SGF.

Komi Komi is a numeric value that is added to the white player\u0026rsquo;s score at the end of the game. Komi is given to the white player as a bonus to compensate for the black player\u0026rsquo;s advantage of having the first move. In an even game, when area scoring is used komi is usually 7½, when territory scoring is used komi is usually 6½. Komi is hidden away on the \u0026ldquo;Advanced settings\u0026rdquo; screen because it is usually automatically adjusted by the app based on other choices made on the \u0026ldquo;New game\u0026rdquo; screen. Although you can adjust it manually, you will find that the app changes the komi value you selected to something else in the following situations:\nSelecting a scoring system sets a default komi suitable for the scoring system (7½ for area scoring, 6½ for territory scoring). Selecting a ruleset that changes the scoring system has the same effect as changing the scoring system itself. Selecting a handicap sets komi to ½. Selecting no handicap sets komi back to the current scoring system\u0026rsquo;s default. While a handicap is selected, changing the scoring system has no effect on komi. It is strongly recommended to leave the komi setting alone and let the app manage it automatically. When the two players are not of equal strength it is recommended that the stronger player give the weaker player a handicap instead of adjusting komi.\nAlso note that when handicap is given and area scoring is used the app will automatically add 1 compensation point per handicap stone to white\u0026rsquo;s score, so using any komi other than 0 or 0.5 points in a handicap game is likely to gravely skew the final score.\nIf you do decide to adjust komi, then the app offers you the following choices:\nFor a game with handicap: 0 or 0.5 points. One of these values can also be used instead of giving 1 handicap stone, in other words if the two players are of almost equal strength. For a game without handicap: A value between 5 and 8 points, with .5 points in between. It is recommended to use a .5 value to avoid draws.\nKo rule Ko is a Japanese go term that, in its most general usage, refers to all sorts of moves that repeat a previous board position and that, if repeated indefinitely, could prevent the game from ending. The ko rule that is in effect during a game forbids moves that could create such a situation. The app supports and lets you choose between the following ko rules:\nSimple ko, also known as \u0026ldquo;basic ko\u0026rdquo;. This rule prohibits capturing moves that restore the same board position that existed immediately before the previous capturing move was played. An example diagram for this can be found on the Go rules page. Positional superko. When this rule is in effect a player may not place a stone that recreates any board position that existed earlier in the game. Situational superko. Similar to positional superko, with the difference that only plays are forbidden that recreate an earlier board position with the same player to move. Pass moves do not contribute to ko and are therefore never forbidden. If you want to know more about simple ko, superko, or repeating cycles in general, then Sensei\u0026rsquo;s Library is your friend.\nScoring system The app lets you choose between two scoring systems to determine the final score after the game ends:\nArea scoring Territory scoring A summary of how the two scoring system work can be found on the Scoring page of this manual.\nIt is strongly recommended that you play with area scoring, because the computer player (Fuego) does not properly support territory scoring. Read more. Life \u0026amp; Death Settling rule The Life \u0026amp; Death Settling rule lets you select the number of pass moves after which normal play should end and the game should enter the life \u0026amp; death settling phase (the goal of which is to determine a final score).\nThe life \u0026amp; death settling phase begins with an attempt to agree on which stones on the board are alive and which stones are dead. If players cannot agree they must resume the game and continue playing to settle any disputes. This cycle is repeated until all disputes have been resolved.\nThe number of pass moves that you select for the Life \u0026amp; Death Settling rule has an effect on how the game is resumed to settle disputes:\n2 pass moves: Play can be resumed to settle life \u0026amp; death disputes without discarding any moves. 3 pass moves: The third pass move must be discarded in order to resume play. This option is used to implement the IGS ruleset. Dispute Resolution rule If in the life \u0026amp; death settling phase players cannot agree on which stones are dead and which stones are alive, players must resume play to resolve the dispute.\nThe option you select for the Dispute Resolution rule decides who plays first:\nAlternating play: The player who plays first is the opponent of the last player to pass. Non-alternating play: Either player is allowed to play first. Four Passes rule If players resume play in order to resolve a life \u0026amp; death dispute, but neither player wants to play and both players pass a second time, the result are 4 consecutive pass moves.\nThe option you select for the Four Passes rule decides what this should mean:\nNo special meaning: The 4 consecutive pass moves have no special meaning and the life \u0026amp; death settling phase continues into the next cycle. End immediately: The game ends immediately after the fourth pass move, with all stones on the board deemed alive! This option is used to implement the AGA ruleset. The purpose of the \u0026ldquo;End immediately\u0026rdquo; option is to avoid the situation where a game does not end because players cannot agree on which stones are dead/alive, but neither player wants to play first to start resolving the dispute.

Crash after zooming the board I cannot load a game, the game is reported to contain errors File sharing changes do not update the archive The computer player plays stupid moves during the end game Computer player making illegal moves It is possible that the app and the computer player (i.e. Fuego) disagree on when a move is legal. This happens when the app and Fuego get out of sync, usually due to some bug in the app. If such a situation occurs, the app will ask you to submit a bug report, or to enable the collecting of logging data (so that when the problem occurs the next time, the bug report can be sent with useful information about the steps that led up to the problem).\nRegardless of whether you agree to the app\u0026rsquo;s suggestions, the game in progress will then be automatically saved to the archive and a new game will be started to bring the app back into a stable state. To continue playing you can try to load the saved game from the archive.\nI can/cannot play X - isn\u0026rsquo;t this against the game rules? You may have found a bug. Don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to email me with a bug report.\nMeanwhile, if you are stuck in an impossible situation (e.g. you cannot capture a stone), you can try to work around the problem by saving the game that is currently in progress, then reloading the game you just saved. Loading a saved game is a generally useful strategy to bring the app back into a sane state whenever the app behaves buggy.\nCrash after zooming the board If the app crashes after you zoom the board it is likely that your device does not have enough memory to support both a fully zoomed board AND the computer player\u0026rsquo;s memory requirements. If this happens, you probably have increased the computer player\u0026rsquo;s Maximum memory setting and should try to reduce that number again to a safe level.\nI cannot load a game, the game is reported to contain errors The app was not designed to be a general purpose SGF file processor/editor, so it is perfectly possible that an SGF file which you imported from an external source may contain data that the app does not understand. For instance, it is not possible (and probably will never be) to load a game with a board that is larger than 19x19.\nIf you believe that the app should be able to load one of your SGF game files, then please email me with a bug report and attach the SGF file in question.\nFile sharing changes do not update the archive Since iOS 5, if you add or remove files via file sharing, the screen in the Archive area of the app does not update automatically. This is a known problem for which a simple workaround exists: Temporarily lock the device, then unlock it again; the list of archived games should now be up to date.\nThe computer player plays stupid moves during the end game The computer player is not very good at calculating the final score on its own. One consequence of this is that you must assist in determining dead stones during scoring. Another consequence is that the computer player is not usually passing early during the end game - it stubbornly keeps on playing far longer than a human player would. If you are playing with area scoring rules, this usually does not affect the final score and thus is merely annoying. If you are playing with territory scoring rules, however, the computer player may lose a game that it would have won with area scoring rules. In some cases the computer player may even resign because its automated territory scoring calculations are incorrect.\nFor these reasons, you should try to play with area scoring rules. That\u0026rsquo;s also why the app uses area scoring rules by default. To change the scoring rules you have to start a new game.\n","description":"Computer player making illegal moves I can/cannot play X - isn\u0026rsquo;t this against the game rules?

The Annotation view displays the annotation data for the game tree node that is currently selected.\nBecause there is not enough screen space available to display all annotations at the same time, the Annotation view is split into two pages. To change from one page to the next you use a swipe-left or swipe-right gesture.\nIn the lower part of the view (highlighted in red in the page 1 illustration below) is an indicator which page of the Annotation view you are currently viewing. Instead of swiping you can tap on the page indicator to go the next or previous page.\nPage 1 On page 1 of the Annotation view there are four buttons representing four of the six types of annotations that you can make. Tapping a button will call up a screen with values that match the button\u0026rsquo;s annotation type. When you select one of the values you annotate the game tree node with the selected value.\nWhen you tap the button labeled \u0026ldquo;Move\u0026rdquo; and select the value \u0026ldquo;Bad move\u0026rdquo;, the game tree node is annotated to the effect that the move in that node, made by whichever player, is a bad move for that player. Annotations page 1, without any annotations The icon used for each button represents the value currently selected for the button\u0026rsquo;s annotation type. In the illustration above all buttons use the icon , which indicates \u0026ldquo;No value\u0026rdquo;. This is the default if you haven\u0026rsquo;t annotated a node yet. Here is an example illustration showing some icons after a value was selected for all four annotation types on page 1.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t remember which value an icon represents you can tap the button and check in the screen that pops up what the icon means.

Here is an example illustration showing how the page looks like when both descriptions are present.\nAlso note that now that descriptions are present the Delete button is enabled.\nAnnotations page 2, with annotations Node content view In the list of nodes of the currently selected game variation, a node content view also displays a bit of annotation data:\nThe view shows the symbol if the node contains any annotation data. The view shows the symbol if the node is designated as a hotspot. The symbol is either black (regular hotspot) or red (intense hot spot). Node content with symbols for annotations and hotspot Annotaton types Short and long descriptions You can write a short and/or a long description text to describe a game tree node. You can use these texts in any way you like, for instance to describe in detail what motivated the move that was played to create the board position, or why the move was particularly good or bad. Description texts might also, for instance, refer to markup that is visible in that board position. To learn more, read the Markup section of this manual.\nThe text you write for the long description has no limits - it can even contain newlines. The short description text on the other hand may not contain any newlines - if you attempt to enter a newline the app will convert it to a space character. By definition the short description text should be succinct so that it can be displayed by a program even if there is not much screen space available.\nPosition valuation You can assign a valuation to a game tree node, such as \u0026ldquo;good for black\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;very good for white\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;even\u0026rdquo;, etc. The position valuation is not tied to a particular move but to the board position as a whole.\nYou can choose from the following positon valuations:\nSymbol Value The position is good for black. The position is very good for black. The position is good for white. The position is very good for white. The position is even. The position is very even. The position is unclear. The position is very unclear. There is no position valuation. Move valuation You can assign a valuation to the move that was being played to create a board position, such as \u0026ldquo;good move\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;very bad move\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;doubtful move\u0026rdquo;, etc.\nYou cannot assign a move valuation if the current game tree node does not contain a move. For instance, you cannot assign a move valuation when you are viewing the node at the start of the game. You can choose from the following move valuations:\nSymbol Value The move is a good move. The move is a very good move. The move is a bad move. The move is a very bad move. The move is interesting. The move is doubtful. There is no move valuation. Hotspot designation You can designate a game tree node to be a \u0026ldquo;hotspot\u0026rdquo; to indicate that something particularly interesting happened in that node. For instance the node contains a game-deciding move. The \u0026ldquo;hotspot\u0026rdquo; is not related to any specific place on the board, but marks the whole board position instead.\nYou can choose from the following hotspot designations:\nSymbol Value The node is a hotspot. The node is an \u0026ldquo;intense\u0026rdquo; hotspot, i.e. the regular hotspot designation is emphasized. There is no hotspot designation. Score estimate You can assign a score estimate to a board position. This consists of the information which side is winning (black or white), and by how much (a numeric value). The score estimate may also indicate a tie.\nBecause score estimates contain numeric data they cannot be shown as symbols, instead they are shown in text form that follows a well-known convention.\nThese are the possible score estimate values:\nScore estimate Value B+\u0026lt;n\u0026gt; Black wins by \u0026lt;n\u0026gt; points. Example: B+3.5. W+\u0026lt;n\u0026gt; White wins by \u0026lt;n\u0026gt; points. Example: W+8.5. Tie The game is a tie There is no score estimate.

For a more thorough treatment please visit one of the many websites dedicated to the game. For instance, an excellent resource is Sensei\u0026rsquo;s Library while another more hands-on interactive tutorial is available on online-go.com.\nPlayers The game is played by two players. One of them plays with black stones, the other with white stones. Usually black makes the first move, except when there is a handicap. This introduction does not cover handicap.\nBoard The board is a grid of horizontal and vertical lines. The standard board size is 19x19, but smaller board sizes are good for teaching games or solving special Go problems. Little Go allows you to set any board size between 7x7 and 19x19. Only board sizes with an odd number of lines are supported to ensure that there is a center point.\nIntersections The lines of the board have intersections wherever they cross or touch each other. Each intersection is called a point. That includes the four corners, and the edges of the board. Stones are placed on points (intersections), which might seem unusual if you are coming from chess.\nMoves Players take alternate turns. When it is their turn, they make a move. A move usually consists of placing a stone. However, a player may also decide to pass, in which case it is the other player\u0026rsquo;s turn. If both players pass, the game is over and the score is calculated to determine who has won the game.\nNote that stones can only be placed on empty points. Also note that it is not possible to move a stone once it has been placed.\nLiberties Each point (intersection) on the board has a number of lines leading away from it to adjacent points. When a stone is placed on a point, the number of lines leading away from it to unoccupied adjacent points are called its \u0026ldquo;liberties\u0026rdquo;.\nFor instance, if a stone is placed in a corner at the start of the game it has 2 liberties, if it is placed on an edge line it has 3 liberties, and if it is placed somewhere in the middle of the board it has 4 liberties.\nLiberties in corner Liberties on edge line Liberties in the middle of the board Enemy stones that surround one of your stones take away liberties from that stone. If your stone has no liberties left it is captured. The opponent removes your stone from the board and places it in a box where at the end of the game it can be used for scoring. The point where your stone was is now unoccupied once more.\nStone still has all 3 liberties Stone has only 2 liberties left Stone has only 1 liberty left Stone has no liberties left and is captured Stone groups If you place stones next to each other so that they are connected through the lines leading away from the points they occupy, they form a stone group. Stones that are adjacent to each other diagonally are not connected through lines and therefore do not form a stone group.\nA stone group with 2 connected stones Stones are not connected Stones in a group share their liberties. For instance, if you place a stone somewhere in the middle of the board it initially has 4 liberties. If you now place another stone on an adjacent point the two form a stone group and together have 6 liberties.\nA single stone with 4 liberties Stones in a group share their liberties, in this case for a total of 6 liberties Stones in a group must be captured as a group, i.e. the opponent must surround the entire group and take away all of its liberties before they can capture it. If they succeed they capture the entire group and remove all stones from the board.\nAn entire stone group is captured after all of its liberties have gone. Suicide rule It is forbidden to place a stone so that it has no liberties. For instance, it is forbidden to place a stone on a point that is surrounded on all sides by enemy stones.\nA white stone in the corner would have no liberties, therefore it cannot be played By extension, it is also forbidden to place a stone if it connects to a stone group and the entire stone group would have no liberties left.\nPlacing a second white stone would create a stone group, but that group would then have no liberties Exception to Suicide rule The exception to the Suicide rule is: You are allowed to place a suicidal stone if by placing it it takes away the last liberty of one or more enemy stones, thus making liberties for its own.\nPlacing a white stone at \u0026#34;a\u0026#34; captures a black stone and thus creates a new liberty for itself No Repetition (ko) rule It is forbidden to play a move which repeats a previous board position. This rule prevents endless repetition in the face of alternating capturing moves due to the exception to the Suicide rule.\nPlacing a white stone at \u0026#34;a\u0026#34; is allowed, but then placing a black stone at \u0026#34;b\u0026#34; immediately afterwards is forbidden because it repeats the first position Note that if some other moves are played in between, the same play may be available again as a legal move, because it will not be repeating the same board position.\nThis rule is also called the \u0026ldquo;ko\u0026rdquo; rule.\nLife Taking all the above rules into account, it is possible to form stone groups that are impossible to capture under normal, alternating game play (also assuming the defending player makes no mistakes). If such a group is formed it is called \u0026ldquo;alive\u0026rdquo;. A group that lives usually surrounds two or more separate areas of empty points. These areas are called \u0026ldquo;eyes\u0026rdquo;.\nThe black stone group is alive! White cannot capture it because they cannot play on \u0026#34;a\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;b\u0026#34; simultaneously The concepts of \u0026ldquo;life\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;eyes\u0026rdquo; are not actually rules, they are just a natural consequence of following the three rules about liberties, suicide and ko. Nevertheless, it is essential to understand \u0026ldquo;life\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;eyes\u0026rdquo; to become better at playing Go. Playing a few games, making mistakes and learning from them usually is the best teacher.\nPurpose of the game The purpose of the game is to occupy or surround more points than the opponent. When the game ends (both players pass), your score is calculated according to the scoring system that you and your opponent agreed upon before the game started.\nFor area scoring (the default in Little Go), calculate your score as follows:\nFirst, remove all dead stones from the board (your own, but also those of your opponent). Stones are dead if they are not \u0026ldquo;alive\u0026rdquo;, i.e. if they could be captured if you were to continue playing. After removal, calculate your score as follows. The number of your stones on the board. Plus the number of empty points only your stones surround. Your opponent\u0026rsquo;s score is calculated in the same way, only from his point of view. Whoever plays white adds komi to his score (komi is usually 7½ and is given to the white player as a bonus to compensate for the black player\u0026rsquo;s advantage of first move).\nWhoever now has the higher score wins the game.\nFor territory scoring (the other major scoring system), calculate your score as follows:\nThe number of enemy stones that you captured during the game Plus the number of enemy dead stones on the board completely surrounded by your stones. See above for a short definition of when stones are dead. Plus the number of points completely surrounded by your stones, regardless of whether they are empty or occupied by enemy dead stones. Komi is usually 6½ for territory scoring An important note about dead stones: You and your opponent must agree on which stones are dead! If your opponent does not agree with your judgment, you must continue the game until the situation in doubt has been settled to both players' satisfaction. While you are new to the game you often will not see what the final outcome of a situation in doubt will be, so you will spend a lot of time in the end game on playouts. This is perfectly OK because you will learn from the experience. Once you get more experienced, though, less situations will have to be played out, making the end game less time consuming (and possible less tedious for your more experienced opponent).\nEtiquette Some of the pleasure of playing Go (when played against a fellow human) comes from following certain points of etiquette that have developed over the long history and tradition of the game. In Little Go, most of the time you will play against the computer, so there is not much point in going into the details of this subject. If you are keen on reading more, though, have a look at this article on Sensei\u0026rsquo;s Library.\n","description":"Overview Players Board Intersections Moves Liberties Stone groups Suicide rule Exception to Suicide rule No Repetition (ko) rule Life Overview This help section contains only a barebones introduction to the rules of Go.

The log size can be changed in the Diagnostics area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Settings \u0026gt; GTP log size\u0026rdquo;.\nCommands are listed in the order in which they were submitted by the GTP client. The most recent command appears at the bottom of the log. The log is dynamically updated when a new GTP command/response is submitted to or received from the GTP engine. You can empty the log in the Diagnostics area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Settings \u0026gt; Clear GTP log\u0026rdquo;.\nEach log entry displays the name of the GTP command and the time when it was sent to the GTP engine. Log entries are also color-coded to mark which type of response was received by the GTP client:\nGreen means a \u0026ldquo;success\u0026rdquo; response. Red means a \u0026ldquo;failure\u0026rdquo; response. A gray question mark (\u0026quot;?\u0026quot;) means that the GTP client is still waiting for a response. The \u0026ldquo;Flip\u0026rdquo; toolbar button can be used to switch between the table-oriented view and the \u0026ldquo;raw\u0026rdquo; view of the GTP log.\nThe New toolbar button can be used to inject your own GTP command into the communication flow between GTP client and engine. Tapping the button displays a screen where you can enter a command using free-form text, or you can select a command from a list of pre-defined commands.\nGTP Log screen Viewing a GTP log entry When you tap an entry in the GTP log, a screen with detail information for that entry is displayed. Most of the information you see here is already available in the log itself. There is one more detail, though, and that is the detailed response string. Most of the time the response to a GTP command just consists of the success/failure status, but for some commands (e.g. \u0026ldquo;genmove B\u0026rdquo;) the response contains more information that is only available on this screen.\nThe \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; toolbar button lets you add the command to the list of pre-defined commands. If there is no \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; button, the command is already pre-defined.\nPre-defined commands Selecting the \u0026ldquo;GTP commands\u0026rdquo; item in the Diagnostics area of the app calls up a screen where you can view and manage a list of pre-defined GTP commands. Usually these will be often-used or complicated commands that you do not want to re-type every time you need to submit them.\nCommands are submitted in the \u0026ldquo;GTP log\u0026rdquo; screen. The \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo; toolbar button lets you delete and re-arrange commands, while the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; toolbar button allows you to add a new command to the list. Tapping an entry in the list presents a detail screen where you can edit the command string.\nThe application comes with a factory set of pre-defined commands which you can freely edit. You can discard your current set and return to the factory set in the Diagnostics area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Settings \u0026gt; Reset predefined commands\u0026rdquo;.\n","description":"The computer player in this app is powered by the open source software library Fuego (external link).

The stone appears after a small delay but is not yet placed. Move your finger around the screen until you are satisfied with the stone\u0026rsquo;s location, then place the stone by taking away your finger from the screen. Voilà.\nWhile a gesture to place a stone is ongoing, a blue cross-hair is following the touch location for a better visual indication where the stone would currently be placed. In addition the Status Text area updates continuously with the coordinates where the stone would currently be placed.\nWhen the new stone hovers over an already existing stone, it is rendered in blue to indicate that the intersection is already occupied.\nFinally, when the new stone hovers over an intersection where it is illegal to play, the Status Text area indicates the reason (e.g. suicide, ko).\nThe magnifying glass Placing a stone, with magnifying glass When board intersections become too small (typically on iPhone devices with smaller screens), a magnifying glass automatically appears to show you the section of the board that is currently under your fingertip. This helps you to place the stone exactly where you want it to be.\nA hotspot in the center of the magnifying glass indicates the exact location where your fingertip touches the screen.\nYou can change various aspects of the magnifying glass\u0026rsquo; behaviour in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Magnifying Glass\u0026rdquo;. For instance, you can set it to appear only if the intersections on the board are smaller than the average fingertip, or you can turn it off entirely.\nThe computer player If your opponent is a computer player, it will take over immediately after you have made your move. While the computer player is thinking, an Interrupt button is displayed in the toolbar. Usually you will want to wait until the computer has finished thinking and made its move, but if you want you can tap the button to interrupt the computer and force it to play its best move right now.\nIf you want to do something else while the computer is thinking, you can always use the tab bar at the bottom of the screen to switch to one of the other areas of the user interface. If you would like to get a notification when the computer has made its move you can turn on audio/vibration feedback options in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Sound \u0026amp; Vibration\u0026rdquo;.\nYou may have noticed that the app has several pre-configured computer players (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Fuego (weak)\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Fuego (strong)\u0026rdquo;, etc.). Follow this link to learn more about the different playing strengths of computer players.\nComputer vs. computer game When you start a new game you can select a computer player to play against itself. Because only one collection of computer player settings can be active at a time, it is not possible to select different players for black and white.\nIn a computer vs. computer game you can\u0026rsquo;t do much more than enjoy watching them battling it out ☺. The Interrupt button lets you cut short the current computer player\u0026rsquo;s thinking, forcing it to play the best move it has calculated so far. If you want to interrupt the whole game you have to tap the Pause button. Once the computer player whose turn it currently is has finished its move, the Menu button becomes enabled so that you can, for instance, save the game in progress or start a new game. Tap the Continue button to let the players continue their match.\nA computer vs. computer game is automatically paused when the device\u0026rsquo;s screen is locked, when you receive a phone call, or whenever some other interruption occurs. Also note that audio/vibration feedback preferences are ignored in a computer vs. computer game because you are merely a spectator and not actively participating in the game.\nLet the computer play for you If you don\u0026rsquo;t know where to play, or are just lazy ☺, you can let the computer play for you by tapping the Computer Play button. Even though the computer is now playing on your behalf, you can interrupt it by tapping the Interrupt button. If your opponent is a computer player, that player will immediately take over, just as if you had made your own move.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t like the computer immediately playing a move for you, you can tell it to instead only make a suggestion how to play. You can then follow the suggestion and play the move, or ignore the suggestion and play somewhere else. You find the setting that controls the behaviour in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Computer assistance\u0026rdquo;. If the temptation to consult the computer all the time is too big you can choose to play without computer assistance.\nAfter you\u0026rsquo;ve changed the setting you will notice that the Computer Play button has been replaced by the Suggest Move button, which displays a different icon. Calculating a move suggestion may take some time and can be interrupted as usual. The app indicates which intersection the computer suggests to play on by blinking a stone a few times to get your attention. If the suggestion is to pass or resign the app displays an alert.\nMaking a move for the computer You can never play on behalf of the computer! Whenever there is a situation where it is the computer player\u0026rsquo;s turn and it does not automatically make its move, you will find that the Computer Play button is enabled. Tapping the button will tell the computer to make its move.\nDiscarding moves If you are not happy with a move you or your opponent made, you can tap the Discard button (visible only if at least one move was made). This will throw away the move that was just made. Whoever made that move can now play again, either somewhere else on the board or at the same intersection. You can also continue to discard more moves.\nOnly in a computer vs. human game and when you\u0026rsquo;re discarding the computer player\u0026rsquo;s move: Your own last move that precedes the computer player\u0026rsquo;s last move is discarded as well. The goal is that you can then immediately play again and try out a different move. This \u0026ldquo;double discard\u0026rdquo; behaviour can be turned off in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Board position \u0026gt; Discard my last move\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen you discard a computer player\u0026rsquo;s move and it is now the computer\u0026rsquo;s turn to play, it does not automatically make its move. You can tell it do so by tapping the Computer Play button (as mentioned above in the Making a move for the computer section).\nGame information Tapping the Game Info button calls up a screen that shows all sorts of interesting things about the game that is currently in progress. For instance you can see which player\u0026rsquo;s turn it is (on the \u0026ldquo;Game\u0026rdquo; segment), but probably the most interesting part is the \u0026ldquo;Score\u0026rdquo; segment which has a table that tells you who would win if the game would end right now. Note that you need to activate Scoring mode if you want the table to display area or territory scores. See the Scoring manual section for more information.\n","description":"Placing a stone The magnifying glass The computer player Computer vs. computer game Let the computer play for you Making a move for the computer Discarding moves Game information Placing a stone Placing a stone Once you have started a new game you are ready to begin playing.\nStart placing a stone by touching the screen near the intersection where you want the stone to end up.

At the beginnng of a game none of the players has yet full control over any territory, but by placing more and more of their stones they start to exert influence over some areas. The app has a feature that, when enabled, tries to estimate both player\u0026rsquo;s influence and displays an indication of that estimate.\nDisplaying player influence is disabled by default. You can enable it in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Display \u0026gt; Display player influence\u0026rdquo;.\nExample Automated calculation of player influence Manual calculation of player influence Technical background Influence on computer player strength Example When the setting is turned on, most intersections on the board will start to show black and white squares of varying size. The color of the square indicates which player has more influence on that intersection, while the size of the square indicates the degree of influence that player has (the larger the square the more influence a player has). By looking at the influence squares on the entire board you can quickly estimate which parts of the board will end up being owned by which player.\nPlayer influence is subjective - it is determined by what the computer player \u0026ldquo;sees\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;thinks\u0026rdquo;. Therefore, if you play against a weak computer player, the player influence being displayed may well be inaccurate, simply because the computer player in its weakness has missed a particularly good move. Even with a strong computer player, you should always take player influence with a grain of salt. Read more. Player influence on an 11x11 board Automated calculation of player influence Player influence is not visible immediately after you turn the setting on. The reason for this is that the computer has not yet collected any of the statistics data that it requires to estimate player influence. Player influence will become visible only after the computer player makes its next move (either its own move, or when it plays on your behalf).\nOnce the initial player influence is visible, it will be updated every time that the computer player makes a move. On the other hand, player influence will never be updated if the computer player does not make a move. The consequence is that you will see outdated/inaccurate player influence in some situations:\nWhen you play against the computer, player influence is not updated immediately after you make your own move. Player influence is updated only after the computer has finished calculating its answering move. When you play against a human opponent, player influence is never updated unless one of you lets the computer make a move on your behalf. When you view old board positions, player influence is never updated because the computer never makes calculations while you jump back and forth in the game\u0026rsquo;s move history. Manual calculation of player influence You can force player influence to be re-calculated by selecting the \u0026ldquo;Update player influence\u0026rdquo; item from the menu that pops up when you tap the Menu button. The calculation will take a while to complete, during that time you will not be able to play.\nThe menu item is not shown when player influence cannot be re-calculated (e.g. during Scoring mode) or, obviously, if the \u0026ldquo;Display player influence\u0026rdquo; setting is disabled. Technical background The computer\u0026rsquo;s method to calculate its best move is to play out a huge amount of hypothetical games in the background, and to evaluate the outcome of each of these playouts. A by-product, so to speak, of each playout is the information whether at the end of the hypothetical game an intersection remains neutral, or belongs to the area owned by black or white.\nBy summing up the results of all playouts, it is therefore possible to say for any given intersection whether it was owned by black more often than by white, or vice versa, or whether there was a tie. The color of the player who owned an intersection more often determines the color of the influence square. The size of the influence square is determined by comparing the percentage of playouts won by either black or white.\nThe accuracy of these playout statistics is governed by how many playout games the computer is allowed to calculate. Few playout games means low accuracy because a particularly strong move and all the playout games descending from it may easily be overlooked. At the same, few playout games also means a weak computer player. In effect, there is a direct relationship between computer player strength and the accuracy of playout statistics / player influence.\nRead the Computer Player section of this manual for more details about how to adjust the computer player\u0026rsquo;s playing strength.\nInfluence on computer player strength The computer player becomes slightly weaker while the display of player influence is enabled. The reason is that collecting the player influence statistics data requires a bit of calculation power that would otherwise be available for calculating the computer\u0026rsquo;s best move.\n","description":"The goal of the game is to gain control over as much territory on the board as possible.

To change the player\u0026rsquo;s name simply tap on the name to call up an edit screen. The \u0026ldquo;Human player\u0026rdquo; switch is off for computer players, but you can toggle it to turn the player into a human player. Warning: When you toggle the switch the computer player\u0026rsquo;s settings are discarded! In this section you control the computer player\u0026rsquo;s playing strength.

In this section you control the computer player\u0026rsquo;s resign behaviour. As with the playing strength you can choose from one of 5 resign behaviours, or you can tap \u0026ldquo;Advanced configuration\u0026rdquo; to change individual options. Read more. Here you can edit a computer player\u0026rsquo;s notes. This is a text of arbitrary length that you can use to describe what settings you chose for this particular computer player. The pre-defined computer players that come with the app use this feature to provide a quick hint how a pre-defined computer player\u0026rsquo;s settings differ from the settings of the other players. The background computer player When a new game with two human players is started there can be situations when the computer\u0026rsquo;s assistance is required. For instance one of the human players might request the app to calculate a move for them by tapping the Computer Play button. In situations like these the app uses a special background computer player to calculate the move or do other computations.\nThe background computer player effectively works like an invisible computer player that performs calculations in the background (hence its name). You can change the background computer players\u0026rsquo; settings exactly the same as you would do for regular computer players. Changes will have an impact, for instance, on the quality of the moves generated by tapping the Computer Play button.\nTo re-iterate: The background computer player is used only in human vs. human games.\nThe Pondering setting is disabled by default for the background computer player. This is by design! Usually players in a human vs. human game do not want to consult the computer player, so if Pondering were enabled by default this would waste a lot of battery power because the computer would be calculating moves in the background all the time. If you would like to improve the playing strength of the background computer player, you should not enable Pondering, but instead increase the Thinking time setting. Playing strength The simplest way to change the settings of a computer player is to select from a number of playing strengths when you are on the \u0026ldquo;Edit player\u0026rdquo; screen. Playing strength 1 is the weakest, playing strength 2 is slightly better, and so on. Each playing strength represents a different set of predefined settings values. By selecting a playing strength you are effectively changing many of the computer players\u0026rsquo; settings with a single tap, without having to understand what the individual settings do.\nIndividual settings are also open to manual tweaking. To do so, tap the \u0026ldquo;Advanced configuration\u0026rdquo; item in the \u0026ldquo;Playing strength\u0026rdquo; section of the \u0026ldquo;Edit player\u0026rdquo; screen. Before you start changing things, however, it is probably a good idea to first read through the next sections so that you better understand what you can accomplish by manipulating the different settings.\nPlaying strength settings Maximum memory This setting defines how much memory in MB the computer is allowed to use for its calculations.\nIn general, the more memory it gets, the better the computer will play. There are a few things that you need to be aware of, though:\nMost important is that your iPhone or iPad only has a limited amount of memory, and the app must share this memory with all the other apps that also run on the device. If iOS (the operating system running on your device) finds that the app behaves badly and uses up too much memory, it will terminate the app after a short delay so that other apps on the device can continue running. To minimize the chance that this happens, the app limits the amount of memory you can assign here to a fraction of the amount of physical memory that the device has. More threads (see below) usually need more memory to be effective. Faster processors will be happy if they get more memory because they can calculate more than slower processors in the same amount of time Number of threads This setting defines how many calculations the computer is allowed to make in parallel.\nIn general, the more threads it gets, the better the computer will play. However, the number of threads should not exceed the number of processor cores that your iPhone or iPad has. At best, too many threads will have no detrimental effect, but it may also be that playing strength suffers because the computer is taking up too much time switching between threads when instead it could make better use of this time in a single thread of straightforward calculations.\nNote that the iPhone 4S is the first iOS device that has a processor with 2 cores, so on older devices you should leave the number of threads set to 1. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know how many processor cores your device has, you can consult one of these Wikipedia pages:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_iPhone_models https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_iPad_models Pondering This setting defines whether the computer is allowed to \u0026ldquo;think\u0026rdquo; while it is not its turn.\nTurning this setting on allows the computer to play better because it gets more time for its calculations. Because the processor uses up more energy, this will have a negative impact on your device\u0026rsquo;s battery life. Pondering time This setting defines how long the computer is allowed to \u0026ldquo;think\u0026rdquo; while it is not its turn.\nIn general, more pondering time means stronger play. Pondering in general is already heavy on your device\u0026rsquo;s battery, so obviously increased pondering time will make the effect worse. Reuse subtree This setting defines whether the computer is allowed to \u0026ldquo;remember\u0026rdquo; some of the results of its calculations from the last turn. Turning this setting off forces the computer to forget the results of its calculations once it has made its move. On its next move it will then need to re-calculate some of the very same results that it has just forgotten.\nTurning this setting on therefore makes the computer play stronger because it can use its allotted time for making new calculations. When the Pondering setting is turned on, \u0026ldquo;reuse subtree\u0026rdquo; must be turned on as well. The app automatically does this for you, and it will also prevent you from accidentally turning the setting off.\nThinking time This setting defines how long the computer is allowed to \u0026ldquo;think\u0026rdquo; while it is its turn.\nIn general, more thinking time means stronger play. The usual equation applies: More computing time = more energy usage = less battery life. In addition, the \u0026ldquo;thinking time\u0026rdquo; setting also has an impact on the user experience: Usually it is desirable that the computer player should not take too long for its turn, and 10 seconds have been found to be a reasonable default value.\nMaximum games This setting defines how many playout games the computer is allowed to calculate before it must decide on a \u0026ldquo;best move\u0026rdquo;.\nIn general, the more playout games the computer is allowed to calculate, the better it will play. When it is the computer\u0026rsquo;s turn, it will calculate until either its thinking time has run out, or until the maximum number of calculated playout games has been reached. Which one of the limits is reached first depends on how fast the processor doing the calculations is.\nMore playout games usually means more time spent computing, which directly translates into more energy used, hence lower battery life. Limiting the computer\u0026rsquo;s playing strength The following thoughts might be helpful if you would like to tweak a computer player\u0026rsquo;s settings to limit its playing strength.\nSetting Maximum games to very low values is guaranteed to cripple the computer player, regardless of your device CPU\u0026rsquo;s number crunching power. Alternatively, you could also lower the value for Thinking time, but if you then use this setting on a new iPhone or iPad the computer player will probably become stronger because the new device has a faster processor, which means it can calculate more in the same amount of time. Assuming you chose Maximum games as the limiting factor, you can simply raise its value to increase the computer\u0026rsquo;s playing strength until you find the threshold that makes for challenging and engaging games. If you continue to raise the value for Maximum games, at a certain point Thinking time will become the limiting factor because the CPU will not be able to calculate all of the playouts allowed by Maximum games in the allotted time. Tampering with Thinking time is something you will usually want to avoid, though, because you will have to wait longer for your opponent to do its thinking, which means that your user experience will suffer. The best two settings that further affect playing strength therefore are Reuse subtree and Pondering. Predefined playing strength settings This section lists the settings that the predefined playing strengths resolve to.\nPlaying strength 1 Playing strength 2 Playing strength 3 Playing strength 4 Playing strength 5 Maximum games 500 5000 10'000 Unlimited Unlimited Reuse subtree Disabled Disabled Disabled Enabled Enabled Pondering Disabled Disabled Disabled Disabled Enabled Pondering time - - - - 5 minutes Maximum memory 32 MB 32 MB 32 MB 32 MB 32 MB Number of threads 1 1 1 1 1 Thinking time 10 seconds 10 seconds 10 seconds 10 seconds 10 seconds The Maximum memory value 32 MB is rather low because it must cater to the oldest iOS device still supported by the app. If you have a newer iPhone, or an iPad, you may wish to increase the value for maximum memory (and/or the thread count) if you feel that the computer player is too weak for you. Resign behaviour A computer player has a resign behaviour which defines how quickly the computer will resign the game. The simple configuration lets you choose from five predefined resign behaviours, while the advanced configuration allows you to define a threshold percentage for each board size.\nHere are a couple of ideas on what you can do with specific resign behaviours:\nIf the computer player is allowed to resign normally, it will often resign immediately when it is faced with an overwhelming handicap (e.g. handicap 6 on a 9x9 board). Setting the resign behaviour to \u0026ldquo;Never resign\u0026rdquo;, however, allows beginners to play with a large handicap on small boards. Strong players who can beat the computer but who like to play out the game to the very end can set the resign behaviour to \u0026ldquo;Stubborn\u0026rdquo; or even to \u0026ldquo;Never resign\u0026rdquo; to get the most out of a game. Resign behaviour settings Resign threshold This setting defines how quickly the computer will resign the game. The computer player resigns if the quality of the best move it can find is below the resign threshold.\nLower thresholds make the computer less likely to resign. A threshold of 0% guarantees that the computer will never resign. Because the computer internally calculates percentages for the quality of its moves, the resign threshold is also expressed in % so that the two values can be compared to each other.\nEach board size has its own resign threshold, because on larger boards the computer engine making the calculations (Fuego) tends to generate slightly higher values for \u0026ldquo;best move quality\u0026rdquo;.\nResign minimum number of games This setting defines the minimum number of playout games that the computer must calculate before it is allowed to use the resign threshold to make a decision about resigning. The idea is that a low number of playout games is less likely to result in high quality moves, thus the computer would resign much too quickly when it would be allowed to decide on only a few playout games.\nAn important consideration for this setting is that the computer will never resign if it has a value that is greater than the value of the playing strength setting Maximum games, because in that case the computer will never calculate more than \u0026ldquo;Resign minimum number of games\u0026rdquo;.\nTo prevent this from accidentally happening, \u0026ldquo;Resign minimum number of games\u0026rdquo; is automatically calculated by default. This mechanism makes sure that whenever the value for Maximum games changes, the value for \u0026ldquo;Resign minimum number of games\u0026rdquo; is automatically adjusted to stay below Maximum games. Although you can disable this feature, it is recommended that you leave auto-calculation turned on.\nThis is how auto-calculation for \u0026ldquo;Resign minimum number of games\u0026rdquo; works:\nMaximum games Resign minimum number of games More than 5000 5000 More than 100 Maximum games - 50 100 or less Maximum games - 1 The value 5000 is used because it is the default that Fuego uses internally for its resign_min_games setting. Predefined resign behaviour settings This section lists the Resign threshold values (in %) for each board size that the predefined resign behaviours resolve to.\nPushover Resign quickly Normal Stubborn Never Factor 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 Board size 7x7 10% 7.5% 5% 2.5% 0% Board size 9x9 10% 7.5% 5% 2.5% 0% Board size 11x11 10% 7.5% 5% 2.5% 0% Board size 13x13 10% 7.5% 5% 2.5% 0% Board size 15x15 16% 12% 8% 4% 0% Board size 17x17 16% 12% 8% 4% 0% Board size 19x19 16% 12% 8% 4% 0% Notes:\nThe resign thresholds of the \u0026ldquo;Normal\u0026rdquo; resign behaviour form the baseline. The percentages for \u0026ldquo;Normal\u0026rdquo; are taken straight from the defaults that Fuego uses internally for its resign_threshold setting. The other resign behaviours apply a factor to this baseline as indicated in the \u0026ldquo;Factor\u0026rdquo; row. For instance, with the \u0026ldquo;Pushover\u0026rdquo; resign behaviour the computer is twice (factor 2.0) as likely to resign as with the \u0026ldquo;Normal\u0026rdquo; resign behaviour. On closer inspection you will see that there are only two board size ranges: 7x7 up to 13x13, and 15x15 up to 19x19. This is again due to the internal defaults of Fuego. The predefined resign behaviours do not contain a value for Resign minimum number of games because that setting is expected to be auto-calculated.

Besides the tree view, the app\u0026rsquo;s user interface provides additiional elements to view the content of and interact with the current game variation. These UI elements are the topic of this page.\nNode list view The current node Node list view entries Quick navigation Last move marker and Next move marker Behaviour that depends on the selected node Discarding nodes Playing a move Scoring Node list view Game variation: A sequence of nodes, starting at the root node and ending at a leaf node.\n(definition from the Glossary section of the Game variations page).\nThe app provides a view that lists the sequence of nodes that make up the current game variation.\nWhen there are many nodes you can use the usual swipe gesture to scroll through the nodes in the node list view.\nOne smaller devices the node list view cannot show as many elements.\nPosition and orientation of the node list view vary depending on how you hold the device:\nPortrait orientation: The list view is located in the screen area between the game board and the tree view. The list view is horizontally oriented and you scroll through it with left/right swipe gestures. Landscape orientation: The list view is located at the left edge of the screen. The list view is vertically oriented and you scroll through it with up/down swipe gestures. List of nodes and their content (iPad) List of nodes and their content (iPhone) List of nodes and their content (vertical) The current node The node list view entry that represents the currently selected node is shown with an orange background color.\nYou can tap on a node list view entry to make the node represented by that entry the current node.\nNode list view entries Each entry in the node list view represents a node. The entry displays details about the node it represents.\nThe following examples illustrate the four main types of node list entries:\nThe root node. Nodes that contain a move. Nodes that contain setup. Empty nodes, i.e. nodes that contain neither a move nor setup. Node list view entry for the root node Node list view entry for a node that contains a move Node list view entry for a node that contains setup Node list view entry for an empty node, i.e. a node that contains no move and no setup The following table explains the meaning of each element that can appear in a node list view entry.\nElement Descripton Symbol A symbol on the left of the entry shows at a glance the main content of the node. Node list view entries use the same symbols as the tree view. Follow this link to see the list of all possible node symbols. Main content description A text that describes the main content of the node is shown in a large font next to the symbol. For move nodes this shows the intersection where a stone was placed (\u0026ldquo;A1\u0026rdquo; in the example illustration), or \u0026ldquo;Pass\u0026rdquo; if the move was a pass move. For non-move nodes this shows a static text: \u0026ldquo;Game start\u0026rdquo; for the root node, \u0026ldquo;Setup\u0026rdquo; for nodes containing setup, and \u0026ldquo;Empty\u0026rdquo; for nodes that contain neither a move nor setup. Detail content description A text that describes the content of the node in more detail is shown in a smaller font below the main content description. For the root node this shows the handicap and komi values (\u0026ldquo;H: 3, K:½\u0026rdquo; in the example illustration, indicating handicap 3 and komi ½). For move nodes this shows the move number (\u0026ldquo;Move 68\u0026rdquo; in the example illustration). For setup and empty nodes no detail text is displayed. Number of captured stones For move nodes the number of stones captured by that move is shown in red color next to the main content description (\u0026ldquo;16\u0026rdquo; in the example illustration). Nothing is shown if the move did not capture any stones, or if the node does not contain a move. An icon that indicates that the node contains annotations. Due to space constraints the icon is not shown for the root node even if the root node contains annotations. or An icon that indicates that the node is designated as a hotspot. Due to space constraints the icon is not shown for the root node even if the root node is designated as a hotspot. An icon that indicates that the node contains markup. Due to space constraints the icon is not shown for the root node even if the root node contains markup. Quick navigation One way to navigate through the nodes of the current game variation is to scroll the tree view or the node list view, then tap a node to select it.\nThe second way is to make use of the set of navigation buttons that are shown by the user interface in a box near the node list view.\nThese buttons jump back and forth in the current game variation with a single tap, which can sometimes be a lot faster than scrolling.\nButtons for navigating within the current game variation Button reference:\nIcon Name Description Go Back Tapping this button goes forward one step and selects the next node in the current game variation. Go Forward Tapping this button goes back one step and selects the previous node in the current game variation. Go to Start Tapping this button jumps to the start and selects the first node in the current game variation. This is always the root node. Go to End Tapping this button jumps to the end and selects the last node in the current game variation. Last move marker and Next move marker While navigating through the nodes of the current game variation, the game board displays two markers:\nLast move marker: A red square marking the stone that was placed by the move in the currently selected node. If the currently selected node contains a pass move, or no move at all, then the last move marker is not shown. Next move marker: The letter \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; marking the intersection where a stone will be placed by the move in the next node after the currently selected node. If the node after the currently selected node contains a pass move, or no move at all, then the next move marker is not shown. Last move marker and next move marker These two markers are intended to help with following the focus of play on the board when you navigate through a sequence of moves one by one. They also help with quickly finding the focus of play when you jump to arbitrary nodes.\nYou can disable the markers in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Display \u0026gt; Mark last move\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Board position \u0026gt; Mark next move\u0026rdquo;, respectively.\nIf the current node contains markup that happens to be located on the intersections that would be occupied by the last/next move markers, that markup takes precedence over the last/next markers. The reason is that explicitly placed markup should always be more important than implicit markup generated by the app. Behaviour that depends on the selected node Certain features of the app behave differently depending on whether the currently selected node is the last node in the current game variation, or a node before the last node.\nDiscarding nodes The general behaviour of the Discard button is described on the How to play page.\nA new behaviour is that when the currently selected node is not the last node of the current game variation, the app also has to discard future nodes that come after the currently selected node.\nThe app in that case displays an alert, giving you the opportunity to abort and keep those future nodes.\nAlthough it is not recommended, you can disable the alert in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Board position \u0026gt; Discard future nodes alert\u0026rdquo;.\nPlaying a move The general behaviour of playing moves is described in detail on the How to play page.\nA new behaviour is that when the currently selected node is not the last node of the current game variation, the app has to decide whether or not to discard future nodes that come after the currently selected node.\nBy default the app will not discard future nodes, instead it will create a new game variation as described on the Game variations page.\nHowever, if you have disabled the corresponding setting in the Settings user interface area under \u0026ldquo;Game variations \u0026gt; Move creates new game variation when future nodes exist\u0026rdquo;, then the app will discard future nodes.\nAs with discarding nodes, the app in that case displays an alert, giving you the opportunity to abort and keep those future nodes.\nThe behaviour of playing a move is identical regardless of whether you play the move or the computer plays the move for itself or on your behalf. Scoring When you look at the score in the Game Info screen, it is always based on the currently selected node.\nWhen you are in Scoring mode and you navigate to a different node, the scoring information shown in the Status Text area is updated automatically to reflect the board position represented by the newly selected node. At the same time, any decisions that you made on which stones are dead or in seki are forgotten.\nSee the Scoring page if you need more information about scoring.\n","description":"The tree view indicates the currently selected game variation with a red path going through all the lines that connect the variation\u0026rsquo;s nodes.\nRead the Game variations page to learn more about the tree view and game variations in general.

There are 5 different symbol types:\nCircle Square Triangle The \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo; symbol (\u0026ldquo;X marks the spot\u0026rdquo;) The \u0026ldquo;Selected\u0026rdquo; symbol. Use this symbol to indicate that something is selected. The \u0026ldquo;Selected\u0026rdquo; symbol can be rendered with a Dot symbol or with a Checkmark symbol. You can select which rendering style to use in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Markup \u0026gt; \u0026lsquo;Selected\u0026rsquo; symbol style\u0026rdquo;. The default is the Dot symbol style.\nHere is how the two styles are rendered in the app:\nSelected symbol, dot style Selected symbol, checkmark style Connections You use markup in this category to draw a connection between two intersections on the board: A start intersection and an end intersection. There are 2 different connection types:\nArrow. This is a connection where the direction from start to end is rendered with an arrow head. Line. This is a connection where the direction from start to end is not visibly rendered. Note that even though you don\u0026rsquo;t see the direction of lines, the start-end direction still exists in the background model data. Markers You use markers to mark up a single intersection on the board. Markers are, in effect, very short labels that consist of only a single character. There are 2 different marker types:\nNumber marker. A number marker is a label that consists of a single digit character in the range 1-9. Letter marker. A letter marker is a label that consists of a single lowercase or uppercase letter from the latin alphabet, i.e. a-z, A-Z. On devices with smaller screens markers may not be shown when a 19x19 board is displayed fully zoomed out. To see any markers/labels that you are missing you have to zoom the board. Labels You use labels to mark up a single intersection on the board. A label consists of an arbitrary length text without any newlines. Although there is no length limit, in practice you should keep label texts as short as possible - drawing multi-word labels on the board is not what you usually want.\nA typical use case for labels is if you want to use different characters than the ones offered by number or letter markers.\nOn devices with smaller screens labels may not be shown when a 19x19 board is displayed fully zoomed out. To see any markers/labels that you are missing you have to zoom the board. Markup user interface When you switch to Markup editing mode the following user interface elements become available:\nMarkup user interface The Play Mode button. Tapping this button leaves Markup editing mode and instead activates Play mode. The Select Markup Type button. Tapping this button pops up a menu that lets you choose what kind of markup you want to place from now on when you interact with the board. The popup menu also contains an Eraser item which when selected lets you delete selected existing markup. The icon used for the button is variable and reflects which markup type is currently selected. In the illustration the button uses the Triangle symbol icon which means that interacting with the board will place a Triangle symbol. The Discard all Markup button. This button is displayed only if there is at least one piece of markup present. Tapping the button discards all markup. The Status Text area shows either instructions how to place the currently selected type of markup, or continuous feedback about an ongoing interaction (e.g. while you are drawing an arrow). Interactions One markup element per intersection A general rule that is important to remember is this: You can mark up an intersection with only one of symbol, marker or label.\nPlacing a new symbol, marker or label, or moving an existing symbol, marker or label to an intersection that already is marked up with a symbol, marker or label, replaces that markup.\nConnections work slightly different: Because connections affect two intersections, the rule here is that there may be no two connections (regardless of type) that have the same start/end intersections.\nDrag \u0026amp; Drop When any markup type except Eraser is selected you can move a markup element simply by dragging it. The markup element is placed on the intersection where you lift your finger.\nWhen you drag a symbol, marker or label to an intersection that is already marked up with a symbol, marker or label, the markup at the destination is replaced by the markup that was dragged.\nWhen you drag a connection endpoint, the endpoint is moved to the intersection where you lift your finger. If this results in a duplicate connection, the connection whose endpoint you drag overwrites the connection whose endpoint already existed on the intersection where you lift your finger.\nYou cannot drag connection endpoints while one of the 2 connection markup types is active, because then the drag gesture is reserved for placing new connections. To drag a connection endpoint you have to select one of the other markup types. If you start a drag operation on an intersection that has both a connection endpoint and a symbol, marker or label, then the drag operation first moves the symbol, marker or label. You can move the connection endpoint only when there is no symbol, marker or label on the same intersection as the connection endpoint.\nIf you start a drag operation on an intersection that has multiple connection endpoints, then the drag operation moves the connection endpoint that it finds first in the background model data.\nPlacing a symbol This section describes the interactions used to place a symbol while one of the five Symbol markup types is selected ( ). Connections and symbols can co-exist on the same intersection. An intersection on which a connection starts or ends therefore counts as free for the purposes of symbol placement. When you tap on a free intersection a new symbol of the currently selected markup type is placed on the intersection.\nWhen you tap on an intersection that is already marked up with a marker or label, the existing marker or label is replaced with a new symbol of the currently selected markup type.\nWhen you tap on an intersection that is already marked up with a symbol, the app replaces the existing symbol with the next symbol in order. The order in which the app cycles through symbols is this:\nCircle Square Triangle \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo; symbol \u0026ldquo;Selected\u0026rdquo; symbol When the cycle reaches the symbol of the currently selected markup type, the markup is cleared instead. Since the intersection is now free, the next tap places a symbol of the currently selected markup type.\nAlthough this textual explanation may sound complicated, the cycling effect is actually very simple and intuitive and is designed to help you quickly find the right symbol without having to switch to a different markup type all the time. Continue to read the following examples, or just try it out.\nWhen the Square markup type is selected and you tap 6 times in a row on an intersection that is initially free, the result is this cycle:\nSquare . Because the intersection is initially free the cycle begins with the symbol of the currently selected markup type . Triangle \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo; symbol \u0026ldquo;Selected\u0026rdquo; symbol Circle Clear. Just before the cycle reaches the currently selected markup type , the markup is cleared instead. Because the cycle started with the currently selected markup type , the clear takes place after all 5 symbols have been cycled through. When the Square markup type is selected and you tap 6 times in a row on an intersection that is initially marked up with a Triangle symbol, the result is this cycle:\n\u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo; symbol . This is the next symbol after the one that initially is on the intersection. \u0026ldquo;Selected\u0026rdquo; symbol Circle Clear. Just before the cycle reaches the currently selected markup type , the markup is cleared instead. Because the cycle did not start with the currently selected markup type , the clear already takes place after only 3 symbols have been cycled through. Square Triangle Placing a marker This section describes the interactions used to place a marker while one of the two Marker markup types is selected ( ). Connections and markers can co-exist on the same intersection. An intersection on which a connection starts or ends therefore counts as free for the purposes of marker placement. When you tap on a free intersection a new marker of the selected markup type is placed on the intersection. The app uses the lowest next free number or letter, starting with 1 / lowercase a, then continuing for numbers to 9, and for letters from a-Z, then from A-Z.\nThe \u0026ldquo;lowest next free number or letter\u0026rdquo; algorithm fills gaps in the numbering / lettering. For instance, if there are already number markers for 1, 2, and 4, then the next number marker placed will be 3, not 5. Similarly, if there are already letter markers a, b and d, then the next letter marker placed will be c, not e.\nYou can turn off this gap filling mechanism in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Markup \u0026gt; Fill marker gaps\u0026rdquo;. When you tap on an intersection that is already marked up:\nIf the existing markup is a marker that has the same type as the marker you are about to place, then the existing marker is replaced and the new marker uses the lowest next free number or letter as explained above. The existing marker\u0026rsquo;s number or letter does not count as \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo;. If the existing markup is a symbol, label, or marker of the other type than the one you are about to place, then the existing symbol, label, or marker of the other type, is cleared first and the tap places a new marker of the selected markup type, just as if the intersection had been free. Placing a label This section describes the interactions used to place a label while the Label markup type is selected (). Connections and labels can co-exist on the same intersection. An intersection on which a connection starts or ends therefore counts as free for the purposes of label placement. When you tap on a free intersection the app displays a popup that lets you enter the label text. The text you enter cannot contain any newlines (any newlines you attempt to enter are converted to a space character) but can be of any length. Despite there being no length limit, you should keep label texts as short as possible. If you cancel the text entry popup then no label is placed.\nIf the text you enter is a single digit or letter that satisfies the criteria of a number or letter marker, the app converts the label to a marker.\nWhen you tap on an intersection that is already marked up:\nIf the existing markup is a label or marker, then the app displays a popup as explained above, but the existing label or marker text is used as the default text. If the existing markup is a symbol, then the existing symbol is cleared first and the tap behaves as if the intersection had been free. Placing a connection This section describes the interactions used to place a connecton while one of the two Connection markup types is selected ( ). Connections and symbols, markers or labels can co-exist on the same intersection. An intersection on which a symbol, marker or label exists therefore counts as free for the purposes of connection placement. Connections have a start intersection and an end intersection.\nYou place a new connection of the selected type by dragging from a start intersection to an end intersection. The start and end intersecions must be different - the app draws a single-intersection connection as a stub (for arrows this is just the arrow head) while you are dragging, but if you end the drag operation while still only one intersection is involved the app will not place the connection.\nYou can place multiple connections that originate from the same intersection as long as they end on different intersections. If you place a new connection and another connection already exists between the same start/end points as the new connection, the new connection replaces the existing one (regardless of whether the existing connection is of the same or of a different type as the new connection).\nWhile one of the Connection markup types is selected you cannot move any kind of markup by dragging, because the drag gesture is reserved for placing new connections. When you tap the start or end intersection of an existing connection, the app deletes that connection. If you tap an intersection that is the start or end intersection of multiple connections, the app deletes the connection that it finds first in the background model data. To delete all connections that start or end on an intersection, repeatedly tap the intersection.\nYou can turn off deletion of connections by tapping in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Markup \u0026gt; Connection tool allows delete\u0026rdquo;. Turning the setting off can be useful if you find yourself accidentally deleting connections instead of placing new ones. Removing markup This section describes the interactions used to remove markup while the Eraser tool is selected. When you tap an intersection that is marked up, the app deletes the markup on the intersection. If there are multiple markup elements on the intersection, all of them are deleted.\nDragging allows you to select a rectangular area in which to delete markup. When you complete the drag operation the app deletes all markup elements from all intersection in the selection rectangle.\nSettings There are a few additional markup-related settings which have not been discussed elsewhere on this page.\nMarkup precedence Although it does not make much sense, the SGF standard allows SGF files to have both a symbol and a label on the same intersection. When you load such an SGF file, the app will draw either the symbol or the label, but not both.\nBy default the app will draw the symbol, but you change this in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Markup \u0026gt; Markup precedence\u0026rdquo;.\nUnique symbols Normally when any of the Symbol markup types is selected you can place the same symbol multiple times, e.g. by tapping on multiple free intersections.When you enable the \u0026ldquo;Markup \u0026gt; Unique symbols\u0026rdquo; option in the Settings area of the app, you can no longer place the same symbol multiple times. Instead on every tap the app chooses a different symbol for you that is unique on the board. When all symbols are on the board you cannot place symbols anymore.\nWhen no symbols are on the board, the Square markup type is selected, and you tap 6 times on different intersections, then 5 symbols are placed in this order: Square , Triangle , \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo; symbol , \u0026ldquo;Selected\u0026rdquo; symbol , Circle . The 6th tap then does nothing anymore because all symbols are already on the board. Having the \u0026ldquo;Markup \u0026gt; Unique symbols\u0026rdquo; setting enabled can be convenient to save a couple of taps if you frequently mark up multiple intersections on the same board position, but want to use a different symbol on each intersection.\nMapping to SGF properties For the technically inclined, here is how each markup type maps to properties defined by the SGF standard.\nMarkup type SGF property SGF property value Remark Symbols Circle CR List of intersections Square SQ List of intersections Triangle TR List of intersections \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo; mark MA List of intersections \u0026ldquo;Selected\u0026rdquo; symbol SL List of intersections Markers Number marker LB List of intersection/text pairs Number markers are labels that consist of only a single digit character.

For your convenience, in the Diagnostics area of the app you will find a button labelled \u0026ldquo;Send a bug report\u0026rdquo;. Tapping the button displays a pre-filled email view that you only need to supplement with your problem description before you can send off the report. You will notice that the email has a file attachment - read more about this file.\nDiagnostics information file Collecting logging data What is inside the diagnostics information file? What is not inside the diagnostics information file? Diagnostics information file size and persistence Diagnostics information file The file attached to the bug report email contains diagnostics information about the current state of the app and the game in progress. This information helps the developer to better diagnose problems that are hard to describe or reproduce. If you ever find that the app behaves badly from time to time, but not all the time, it will be most useful if you send a bug report (and thus generate a diagnostics information file) right then and there when you notice the problem.\nYou should also enable the collecting of logging data before you send the bug report. The Diagnostics area of the app also has a button, labeled \u0026ldquo;Generate diagnostics information\u0026rdquo;, that lets you just generate the diagnostics information file without sending an email. This can be useful if your device is not capable of sending email, or if you just want to snapshot the application behaving badly now, but send the bug report later. Once you have generated the diagnostics information file, you can use file sharing to transfer the file to your computer, and send the bug report from there. The archive page has more information about how file sharing works.\nCollecting logging data In the Diagnostics area of the app, just above the bug reporting buttons, there is an option \u0026ldquo;Collect logging data\u0026rdquo;. While this is enabled, a log file is written in the background that captures technical details about what you do with the app, which functions you execute, and what steps in detail the app performs in response to your requests.\nSending a bug report without logging enabled is useful, but the diagnostics information file that is attached to the report contains only a snapshot of the state the application is in at the moment the report is generated. If you enable logging, however, the diagnostic information file (which now includes the log file) will document how the application got into its erroneous state. This is a great help for reproducing a problem, especially when you yourself in your bug report cannot describe exactly the steps to reproduce the problem.\nFor the log file to be useful, you must have logging enabled for some time before you actually send the bug report. Ideally, logging would be turned on from the moment when the application is launched, up to the moment where you experience the bug and send the report. Although it is such a useful thing, logging is disabled by default, mainly because you may have privacy concerns. The secondary reason for disabling logging by default is because it uses a few of your device\u0026rsquo;s resources: The log file may grow to a maximum size of 10 MB, and writing the file requires a few write cycles of the solid state drive in your device.\nWhat is inside the diagnostics information file? The file is a ZIP archive that contains the following pieces of information:\nA version number that identifies the format of the information inside the attachment. The iOS version and device type (only whether it is an iPhone or an iPad). A snapshot of some of the app\u0026rsquo;s in-memory objects that make it possible to reproduce the state of the app exactly the way it was at the time the diagnostics information file was generated. Your current preferences (including the players you have defined and the settings you use for your computer players). An SGF file representing the game that is currently in progress. A screenshot of the Play area of the app (excluding the status bar, i.e. the name of your carrier is not in the screenshot). The output of the \u0026ldquo;showboard\u0026rdquo; GTP command. The log file (if logging was previously enabled). What is not inside the diagnostics information file? The file does not contain any information that identifies you or your device, nor any other information that comes from outside the app.\nIf you are concerned, please feel free to inspect the content of the file by forwarding the email to your Mac or PC before you send the bug report to me. As already mentioned further up, you can also transfer the file to your computer via file sharing and inspect the file there.\nFinally, since the app is open source you can also study the program code that produces the file. Let me know and I will point you in the right direction.\nDiagnostics information file size and persistence The diagnostics information file\u0026rsquo;s size varies with the current game\u0026rsquo;s board size, the number of moves made so far, your device\u0026rsquo;s screen resolution, and whether a log file is included or not. By far the largest part is the log file: This can grow up to 10 MB, but since the diagnostics information file is .zip compressed the end result is much smaller.\nWithout including the log file, the smallest diagnostics information file sizes can be below 1 MB, while the largest files should not take up more than a couple of MB.\nFor technical reasons, a copy of the file remains on your device after the bug report email has been generated. The copy is located in the documents folder within the the app app bundle where it is not accessible to any other apps - even the app will not use the copy after the bug report has been sent. If you generate another bug report, the lingering file from the previous bug report is overwritten. If you want to get rid of the file you can delete it via file sharing.\n","description":"To report a bug, please send an email to herzbube@herzbube.ch that contains a description of the problem and, if possible, step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce it.\nBug reports without a minimal problem description are likely to be ignored.

Because the scoring rules may affect decisions how to play, you are not allowed to change the scoring rules in the middle of the game.\nTypically you select the scoring system in the \u0026ldquo;New Game\u0026rdquo; screen by selecting a ruleset. The IGS (Pandanet) and the Japanese rulesets use territory scoring, all the other rulesets use area scoring. You can also manually choose the scoring system in the \u0026ldquo;New Game\u0026rdquo; screen, under \u0026ldquo;Advanced Settings\u0026rdquo;.\nThe default ruleset \u0026ldquo;Little Go\u0026rdquo; uses area scoring. Read on why this is important.\nWhy area scoring is the default The reason why area scoring is the default is that the computer player (Fuego) does not properly support territory scoring. This can be felt towards the end game when the computer engine sometimes makes unnecessary moves:\nUnder territory scoring rules, each stone placed inside your own territory is a lost point because it makes your territory smaller. Each stone placed into your opponent\u0026rsquo;s territory is also a lost point because it gives your opponent an additional prisoner. Under area scoring rules, both types of play are neutral: A stone placed inside your own territory makes your territory smaller, but it also gives you a point for the stone itself. A stone placed inside your opponent\u0026rsquo;s territory is not relevant because under area scoring rules prisoners do not count. The bottom line is that under territory scoring rules the computer player may lose a game that it would have won under area scoring rules. In some cases the computer player may even resign because its automated territory scoring calculations are incorrect.\nArea scoring and territory scoring, revisited Here is a summary of how the two scoring systems work:\nArea scoring. In this scoring system a player\u0026rsquo;s score is calculated as follows: The number of empty points which only the player\u0026rsquo;s stones surround. Plus the number of the player\u0026rsquo;s stones on the board. Territory scoring. In this scoring system a player\u0026rsquo;s score is calculated as follows: The number of empty points which only the player\u0026rsquo;s stones surround. Minus the number of empty points surrounded in seki. Minus the number of the player\u0026rsquo;s stones that have been killed (whether captured during the game, or removed from the board as dead stones at the end of the game). Add compensation to white\u0026rsquo;s score: Komi is added to white\u0026rsquo;s score in both scoring systems. As a reminder: komi is white\u0026rsquo;s compensation for black\u0026rsquo;s advantage of having the first move. Only when area scoring is in effect and it is a handicap game: The number of handicap stones is added to white\u0026rsquo;s score to compensate for the value that black would receive if the handicap stones were still on the board. In essence, black already received a huge strategic advantage from the free handicap stones and should not benefit a second time from the value of the stones on the board. It is beyond the scope of this manual to explain the finer details that arise from the differences between the two scoring systems. Here are just two key points:\nWhen area scoring is in effect a player can place a stone in their own territory without negatively impacting their own score, whereas when territory scoring is in effect a stone placed within a player\u0026rsquo;s territory reduces that player\u0026rsquo;s score by 1. When area scoring is in effect, placing a stone in neutral territory adds 1 point to the player\u0026rsquo;s score, whereas when territory scoring is in effect a stone placed into neutral territory has no effect on the player\u0026rsquo;s score. The best way to find out more about the two scoring systems is to practice and play a few games. For the nitty gritty details it is recommended to check out Sensei\u0026rsquo;s Library.\nHow to view the score Whenever you want to view the current score, you tap the Game Info button, then you select the \u0026ldquo;Score\u0026rdquo; segment.\nAs shown in the following images, the table displays different entries depending on the scoring system that is in effect for the current game. Refer to the previous section to find the meaning of each entry.\nTable entries when area scoring is in effect:\nGame Info screen, score tab, area scoring Table entries when territory scoring is in effect:\nGame Info screen, score tab, territory scoring If you view the score while the game is still in progress, you will notice that some of the scoring table rows show \u0026ldquo;n/a\u0026rdquo; instead of numbers, and that the final score therefore is not meaningful. The reason for this is that, unfortunately, Little Go is not very smart about calculating the score - it relies quite heavily on your help with evaluating which stones on the board are alive, which ones are dead and which ones are in seki. To provide this help you have to activate Scoring mode.\nActivating and leaving scoring mode How to activate scoring mode To activate Scoring mode, tap the Menu button, then select the \u0026ldquo;Score\u0026rdquo; item from the menu that pops up.\nScoring mode can be activated at any time during normal game play, and it will activate automatically when the game ends after two or three consecutive pass moves. Automatic activation can be turned off in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Scoring \u0026gt; Auto scoring / resuming play\u0026rdquo;. Automatic activation never happens if a player resigns, because in that situation the other player automatically wins and the score is not relevant. If you want you can manually activate Scoring mode even if a player resigned.\nWhile Scoring mode is active you cannot play moves or perform any other actions that influence the game state (exceptions are loading a game from the archive, or starting a new game).\nHow to leave scoring mode To leave Scoring mode you simply tap the Play button. This will return you to Play mode.\nWhen you return to Play mode and the game has not yet ended, you simply continue playing. If you want to re-activate Scoring mode you can do so by again selecting the \u0026ldquo;Score\u0026rdquo; item from the menu that pops up when you tap the Menu button (as explained in the previous section).\nWhen you return to Play mode and the game has ended, you cannot make any moves, so the usual Pass button and Computer Play button are not displayed. In their, place, you will now see a Scoring button that you can tap to re-activate Scoring mode. Tapping the button is faster than if you had to call up the menu, and because the Scoring button and the Play button are shown in the same location, they allow you to quickly toggle between Scoring mode and Play mode.\nLife \u0026amp; death settling Territory markup When Scoring mode becomes active, the app takes a moment while trying to find suggestions for an initial set of dead stones. This feature is optional and can be turned off in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Scoring \u0026gt; Find dead stones\u0026rdquo;.\nAfter the initial set of dead stones is determined, the board is divided up into what Little Go thinks are black and white territories:\nBlack\u0026rsquo;s territory is marked using a blackish translucent overlay. White\u0026rsquo;s territory is marked using a whitish translucent overlay. Neutral territory is not marked at all. \u0026ldquo;Inconsistent\u0026rdquo; territory (see further down) is marked with a red dot symbol. Territory markup in Scoring mode Marking dead stones You can now tap a stone to mark it (and its group) as being dead. Territory coloring is immediately updated to display the new state. Note that the stones you marked as being dead are displayed with a small red \u0026ldquo;x\u0026rdquo; in the center. Stones marked as dead can be \u0026ldquo;unmarked\u0026rdquo; by tapping them again, thus turning them back to alive status.\nWhenever you change the dead/alive state of one or more stones, the updated total score is displayed in the Status Text area. To view the updated detail score you can display the Game Info screen.\nAssistance with marking dead stones If you have a game with many small stone groups that are all dead, marking them will quickly become tedious. You can get a bit of assistance by turning on an option in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Scoring \u0026gt; Mark dead stones intelligently\u0026rdquo;.\nFrom now on, whenever you toggle the dead/alive status of a stone group, Little Go will help you by automatically toggling adjacent stone groups of the same color to the same dead/alive status.\nMarking stones in seki Tap the Menu button, then select the \u0026ldquo;Start marking as seki\u0026rdquo; item from the menu that pops up. From now on tapping stones no longer marks them as dead or alive, instead it marks them as being in seki. Stones in seki are displayed with a whitish rectangle. Stones marked as being in seki can be \u0026ldquo;unmarked\u0026rdquo; by tapping on them again, thus turning them back to alive status.\nRevert to marking dead stones by tapping the Menu button and selecting the \u0026ldquo;Start marking as dead\u0026rdquo; item from the menu that pops up.\nMarking stones as in seki is mainly intended to be used when territory scoring is in use. In that case, stones marked as in seki are treated as neutral territory, hence they do not count towards either player\u0026rsquo;s score.\nIf area scoring is in use, stones in seki are counted as if they were marked alive. So even though marking stones as in seki is still possible with area scoring, it really does not make much sense.\nInconsistent territory When the app finds an empty territory where the state of adjacent dead or seki stone groups is inconsistent, it will mark that territory in a special way (a red dot symbol by default). The definition of \u0026ldquo;inconsistent\u0026rdquo; is:\nThere are dead stone groups for both black and white. Or there are both dead and alive stone groups of the same color. Or there are both seki and non-seki stone groups in any color combination (effectively, seki stone groups must always be surrounded entirely by alive stone groups of the opposing color, except where they share neutral territory with other seki stone groups). The reason for marking up inconsistent territory is to give you notice that a stone group has probably been erroneously marked as dead, alive or in seki.\nOften inconsistent territory is just a transient state while you are marking several stone groups and are on the way to a consistent state. Just ignore the markup when this is the case. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like the \u0026ldquo;red dot symbol\u0026rdquo; way to mark inconsistencies, you can change the markup type in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Scoring \u0026gt; Inconsistent territory\u0026rdquo;.

A section with a summary of the first game found in the SGF file. An SGF file can contain multiple games, so this section can appear multiple times. Each game will have its own summary section titled \u0026ldquo;Game \u0026lt;n\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo;, where \u0026lt;n\u0026gt; indicates the number of the game within the SGF file. The summary is intended to contain enough information to distinguish the games within an SGF file from each other. Note: Most SGF files contain only a single game. If the summary is not enough and you want to know more about the game you can tap the \u0026ldquo;Show details\u0026rdquo; item to call up a screen with all information about the game that is available in the SGF file. Tap the \u0026ldquo;Load game\u0026rdquo; item at the bottom of a game\u0026rsquo;s summary section to load that game and inspect its content on the game board in the Play area of the app. The procedure to load the game is very similar to starting a new game from scratch. The difference is that you cannot choose board size, komi or handicap, as these parameters are part of the saved game. Failure to load SGF data The app may not be able to load the SGF data in an SGF file if the file content does not conform to the SGF standard in some way. When this happens the app displays an item \u0026ldquo;No games available\u0026rdquo; instead of one or more sections titled \u0026ldquo;Game \u0026lt;n\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo;.\nIf the problem is not too severe the app in addition displays a \u0026ldquo;Force loading\u0026rdquo; button that you can tap to load the SGF data in the SGF file despite the formatting issues.\nSee the Smart Game Format (SGF) page for an in-depth discussion of how syntax checking works. If the failure to load the SGF data is related to the SGF file\u0026rsquo;s text encoding then changing the app\u0026rsquo;s text encoding settings may help overcome the problem.\nSaving a game In the Play area of the app you can save the game that is currently in progress by selecting the \u0026ldquo;Save game\u0026rdquo; item from the menu that pops up when you tap the Menu button.\nYou do not need to save the current game before you close the app. The app will save the current game automatically so that when you reopen the app you can continue playing where you left off. After selecting the \u0026ldquo;Save game\u0026rdquo; menu item the \u0026ldquo;Save game\u0026rdquo; screen will pop up. Here you first enter a name for the saved game, then you tap the \u0026ldquo;Done\u0026rdquo; toolbar button to actually save the game.\nIf there already is a game saved under the name that you entered the app will inform you and ask for confirmation whether you want to overwrite the existing game.\nWhen you open the \u0026ldquo;Save game\u0026rdquo; screen the app will suggest a unique game name, i.e. a name for which no other game already exists in the archive, so that you can quickly tap \u0026ldquo;Done\u0026rdquo; and be ready to continue the game. The suggested game name is based on the names of the participating players, with a numeric suffix added for uniqueness. Example: \u0026ldquo;John vs. Jane 1\u0026rdquo;. File sharing You can transfer SGF files from the archive to your macOS computer, or vice versa, via file sharing on the computer.\nSelect the iOS device in the Finder. Select the \u0026ldquo;Files\u0026rdquo; tab.

You should now see the SGF files that you have stored in the app on this iOS device. Use drag \u0026amp; drop to copy files to/from the iOS device. SGF files copied to the iOS device will not automatically show up in the app\u0026rsquo;s game archive. Use any one of the following workarounds to make the files appear.\nTemporarily lock the screen of your iOS device, then unlock it again. Switch to a different app, then switch back to Little Go. Activate the Home screen (which sends Little Go to the background), then re-activate Little Go. Importing SGF files from other applications If you have an email message with an SGF file attachment, you can open that message in the Mail app on your device, then tap on the file attachment. Mail will offer a selection of the applications that can process the file. You should see Little Go among those applications. When you select Little Go the file will be imported into Little Go\u0026rsquo;s archive.\nIf you have other applications that are capable of exporting SGF files (e.g. DropBox) you should be able to import those files into Little Go in a similar fashion as you did with Mail.\n","description":"The Archive area of the app is where you manage your saved games, or games imported from external sources.

If you like you can tap the Scoring button to manually activate Scoring mode. See the Scoring section of this manual for more information on how scoring works.\nYou can undo the decision to resign by selecting \u0026ldquo;Undo resign\u0026rdquo; from the menu that pops up when you tap the Menu button. The decision to resign is also undone automatically when you discard the last move.\nEnding the game by passing One of the game rules that you select when you start a new game determines whether the game will end after two or after three consecutive pass moves. Typically you choose the number by selecting a ruleset in the \u0026ldquo;New Game\u0026rdquo; screen.\nIGS (Pandanet) ruleset: The game ends after three consecutive pass moves. All other rulesets: The game ends after two consecutive pass moves. You can also manually choose the number in the \u0026ldquo;New Game\u0026rdquo; screen, under \u0026ldquo;Advanced Settings \u0026gt; Life \u0026amp; death settling after \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen the game ends after two or three consecutive pass moves, the app automatically activates Scoring mode. See the Scoring section of this manual for more information on how scoring works.\nYou can disable the automatic activation of Scoring mode in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Scoring \u0026gt; Auto scoring / resuming play\u0026rdquo;. When automatic activation is disabled you have to manually activate Scoring mode by tapping the Scoring button.\nResuming play Resuming play after a game has ended by passing When a game ends by two or three consecutive pass moves, the life \u0026amp; death settling phase begins where you and your opponent must agree on the life \u0026amp; death status of all stones on the board. If you and your opponent cannot agree on the life \u0026amp; death status of some stones, you must resume play and resolve the dispute by playing out the situation in question.\nResuming play after three pass moves When the game has ended with three consecutive pass moves, the procedure to resume play is the same as when you play on IGS (Pandanet): You resume play by discarding the third pass move. This is like the \u0026ldquo;undo\u0026rdquo; function\u0026quot; on IGS (Pandanet).\nThe player to play first is the opponent of the last player to pass. In other words: The game continues with normal alternating play.\nResuming play after two pass moves When the game has ended with two consecutive pass moves, you can resume play by two slightly different methods:\nAutomatically resume play: Tap the Play button. The main purpose of this button is to deactivate Scoring mode and return you to play mode. A convenient and natural side effect of the button, however, is that it also automatically resumes play. You can disable this automatism in the Settings area of the app under \u0026ldquo;Scoring \u0026gt; Auto scoring / resuming play\u0026rdquo;. In that case, tapping the Play button merely switches from Scoring mode back to Play mode and you have to manually resume play. Manually resume play: Select the \u0026ldquo;Resume play\u0026rdquo; item from the menu that pops up when you tap the Menu button. If Scoring mode is active, selecting \u0026ldquo;Resume play\u0026rdquo; will deactivate it and return you to Play mode. The player to play first depends on the \u0026ldquo;Dispute Resolution\u0026rdquo; game rule that you selected when you started the game. Typically you choose the rule\u0026rsquo;s setting by selecting a ruleset in the \u0026ldquo;New Game\u0026rdquo; screen.\nThe Chinese and Japanese rulesets allow non-alternating play. All other rulesets enforce alternating play (i.e. the player to play first is the opponent of the last player to pass). You can also manually choose the rule\u0026rsquo;s setting in the \u0026ldquo;New Game\u0026rdquo; screen, under \u0026ldquo;Advanced Settings \u0026gt; Dispute resolution\u0026rdquo;.\nOnly if the game rules allow non-alternating play: Immediately after you resume play, the app presents you with a choice which side (black or white) is to play first. If you make the wrong choice, you can tap the Menu button and select the menu item \u0026ldquo;Set \u0026lt;side\u0026gt; to move\u0026rdquo; to revert your decision. This menu item disappears once the first move has been made.\nOther game-ending scenarios When you load an SGF file that you obtained from an external source you may see the app displaying that a player wins on time, or wins by forfeit. The app supports displaying these game results to properly show you what is stored in an SGF file.\nThe app itself has no function for ending a game due to running out of time because it does not support timed play. Also the app has no concept for forfeiting games because it is not designed to be used in tournaments or similar serious environments.\nYou can undo a game-ending timeout or forfeit from the menu that pops up when you tap the Menu button, exactly the same as you would do to undo the decision to resign. The menu items are named \u0026ldquo;Undo timeout\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Undo forfeit\u0026rdquo;, respectively.\nA game-ending event is also undone automatically when you discard the last move.\n","description":"Ways to end the game Resigning Ending the game by passing Resuming play Resuming play after a game has ended by passing Resuming play after three pass moves Resuming play after two pass moves Other game-ending scenarios Ways to end the game Resigning You can resign when it is your turn to play by selecting \u0026ldquo;Resign\u0026rdquo; from the menu that pops up when you tap the Menu button.\nWhen a player resigns, Scoring mode is not activated automatically because it is clear that the resigning player has lost the game."},{"id":28,"href":"/game-editing/","title":"Game editing","parent":"Little Go User Manual","content":"This section of the user manual contains pages describing the app\u0026rsquo;s features for editing game data besides playing moves.\n","description":"This section of the user manual contains pages describing the app\u0026rsquo;s features for editing game data besides playing moves."},{"id":29,"href":"/ui-basics/play-status-text/","title":"Status Text in the Play area","parent":"User interface basics","content":"On the Play area there is always a small area that shows context-related textual information about what is currently going on in the game.

The app also restores the game as it was when you played the last time, so there is no need to manually save the game unless you want to archive it for reviewing it at a later time.\nIf this is the very first time that you run Little Go, it will start a completely new game with these default settings:\nA 9x9 board An even game (i.e. no handicap and a komi of 7½) Simple ko rules Area scoring The game will end after two consecutive pass moves Also, the game that is started is a human player vs. computer player game.
