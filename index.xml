      <description>When you start a new game, instead of beginning to play you can switch to Board Setup mode. In this mode you can place black or white stones in any order and combination to set up the initial board before you begin to play moves. The only restriction is that the board position you thus create is legal. In practice this means that the app will not allow you to place stones that create a stone group that has no liberties.</description>

      <description>The Play area of the app always displays the Game Info button. Tapping the button calls up the &amp;ldquo;Game Info&amp;rdquo; screen which shows all sorts of useful information about the game that is currently in progress.&#xA;The screen uses tabs to organize the content it displays. When you call up the screen the app automatically activates the tab that was selected when the screen was open the last time.&#xA;The &amp;ldquo;Score&amp;rdquo; tab The &amp;ldquo;Game&amp;rdquo; tab The &amp;ldquo;Board&amp;rdquo; tab The &amp;ldquo;Score&amp;rdquo; tab The &amp;ldquo;Score&amp;rdquo; tab displays scoring information in a tabular fashion.</description>

      <description>A game of Go on a phyiscal board is a linear sequence of moves. Go computer programs such as this app allow to add variations to the main line of moves, in order to explore alternate sequences of moves that in some way differ from the main line.&#xA;This manual page introduces the concept of a &amp;ldquo;game tree&amp;rdquo; to organize game variations, presents a glossary with term definitions that are important to understand the game tree concept, and then shows with numerous illustrations how the app&amp;rsquo;s tree view feature works in detail.</description>

      <description>Items listed in the Archive area of the app (see The game archive) are games saved in the Smart Game Format, which is generally abbreviated to SGF. The format is decades old and widely used to store and transfer Go games between computer systems. External link to SGF specification.&#xA;The app internally uses a software package named SGFC (the SGF Syntax Checker &amp;amp; Converter) to load and save SGF data.

      <description>List of UI areas How to edit the tab bar Little Go&amp;rsquo;s user interface consists of several distinct areas. A tab bar at the bottom of the screen lets you navigate between those areas. Only one area can be visible at any given time.&#xA;The number of areas exceeds the available space in the tab bar even on the largest devices. The right-most tab therefore is always the &amp;ldquo;More&amp;rdquo; tab, which when activated shows a list of those areas that didn&amp;rsquo;t fit on the tab bar.</description>

      <description>The computer player in this app is powered by the open source software library Fuego (external link). Behind the scenes the app and Fuego talk to each other via GTP - the Go Text Protocol. In the GTP context, Fuego is called the GTP engine, while the app is the GTP client.&#xA;In the Diagnostics area of the app there are a few items at the top of the screen that let you peek into what&amp;rsquo;s going on between GTP client (the app) and the GTP engine (Fuego).</description>

      <description>The goal of the game is to gain control over as much territory on the board as possible. At the beginnng of a game none of the players has yet full control over any territory, but by placing more and more of their stones they start to exert influence over some areas. The app has a feature that, when enabled, tries to estimate both player&amp;rsquo;s influence and displays an indication of that estimate.</description>

      <description>Coordinates Move numbers Notification when computer makes a move Coordinates By default the app does not display any game board coordinates, because these consume precious screen estate that could otherwise be used for drawing a slightly larger game board. This becomes especially important when you play on a large board on a device with a smaller screen.&#xA;You can enable coordinate labels in the Settings area of the app under &amp;ldquo;Display &amp;gt; Display coordinates&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>You can place various types of graphical elements on the board to point out noteworthy stones or figures. These graphical elements are summarily called &amp;ldquo;markup&amp;rdquo;. One typical usage is to combine markup elements with a short and/or long description annotation text (see the Annotations section of this manual) that further explains the meaning of the markup elements.&#xA;Every game tree node contains its own set of markup elements, independently from any markup that might be present in other nodes.</description>
